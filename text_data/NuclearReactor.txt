a big problem I find when you can power stations is the scale of them makes them a little confusing but honestly it all just boils down you've got yourself a nuclear reactor hair is kind of like a capital X in the world is not heated by electricity it's heated by nuclear fuel boiling water produces steam steam comes down the pipe and that it impacts on the turbine which is essentially a bunch of strings on a spindle that produces electricity and how you present yourself a happy time the thing that makes a nuclear power station different from a conventional loan how the water is heated to form stage at the sea that I need to go into the Reactor Core itself this is the heart of a nuclear reactor and not many people get to stand here because when active be around 300 degrees Celsius under similar pressure to find half a mile below the ocean pushing these rules apply the force of around 40,000 tons of where is a we energy coming from to do that it's coming from down here these a nuclear fuel assemblies if operational this small space would be packed with these giving out with the amount of energy in the form of heat I'm not every one of these Square Michael chips would be packed with thousands of little pellets like this pallets made of uranium oxide and uranium special to us and we can split when things break apart they tend to release the energy stored in whatever was holding them to go or stretched elastic band, come in split I end up with is too small high energy elements flying in opposite directions to into the surroundings moving things are big differences to do that Tupac Holden Utah winter clothing to become unstable what is what is releasing old energy USA release 2 or 3 more neutrons that can fly off into the surroundings trouble thing is still not really enough to sustain a nuclear reaction because uranium atoms absorb Kingsley the new Trans need to be coming just the right speed and about this whole reactor needs one more thing the boy that plays a pivotal role slows down the neutrons speed weather causing them to become unstable energy anyway stainable generating quickly power station motivational bodybuilding video on November 18th 2013 tibco started to remove fuel from the unit 4 spent fuel pool at Fukushima daiichi nuclear power station during this fuel stored in the spent fuel pool is placed inside a transportation cost and then transported to the common pool Capco is serving with the utmost attention is paid to the safe to the people and then impact on the surrounding environment tepco has taken a significant step forward slip to decommission the focus daiichi nuclear power station which will require 30 to 40 years to complete first cost in which the fuel is he transported is loaded into the spent fuel pool next a newly-installed fuel handling machine Cafe list of fuel assemblies one by one at a speed of approximately 1 centimeter per second and loads them into the cost just possible that small pieces of debris have become trapped between the fuel and The Rock Devil we conducted carefully watching and confirming each stage by an underwater camera and a measuring instrument the fuel loading takes place on the water radiation shielding that all the radiation dose around the work area does not increase the fuel handling machine is equipped for the which automatically stops the machine when abnormal weight is detected we will continue the work with full attention paid to safety cost loaded with 22 Phyllis and place is loaded with a crane to a trailer on the ground while structure Lacoste employees double wise and is capable of raising and lowering the cost using only one while there for even in the likely event that one of the last breaks the cost will not fold the cost is transported to another building and the fuel taking out a stored in the common pool we have conducted this operation 1200 times previously and therefore have experience for them all the operations were fully prepared and trained for this operation but it's on Blue by participating in a spell program on using the fuel handling machine on the crane in addition we have received confirmation on the operation for mr. nightmare an outside expert and Obama US nuclear Regulatory Commission official and from other International third parties we will conduct this operation safely and steadily transferred 1533 assembly scheduled for completion by the end of 2014 fourthly 3 weeks every 18 months the carefully orchestrated series of critical project Eminence Comanche Peak nuclear power plant with the most impeccable exactitudes the main purpose is to change out the core core is the region of the reactor that contains the fuel and the nuclear reaction and all it holds nearly 200 assemblies roughly half of which were eesti chided for taking out of the core placed in the fuel building they already complete reassembly phase will place the head back on the reactor vessel bolt everything up and then be able are ready to start playing backup refueling maybe the main purpose but it's far from the only one from diesel generators were the plants mainor mergency power supply internal inspections of the engine quit will do piston and liner inspections filter change yeah it's a little calibration check steam generator and many things in between we also Google put that we can't work on while the power of units running does it take to make all of that happen as many as 100 and Floyd begin planning every detail of the as far as 18 months out then takes an additional 1000 contractors and around the clock staff control center to ensure safe and precise execution don't know our key to success is how well we prepare and healthy flea they perform this task that we perform on Earth women that ensures that in the equipment meets the safety standards necessary with the surveillance test and 2000 safety observation completed this outage alone safety is unquestionably her or more warm excellent It's a job that's always top of mind and never finished not even when the outage is the true successor tomorrow is always being raced final limit for Community peace I'm actually very so my name is Kayla Wilson I am 17 years old I am a nuclear physicist which may be a little hard to believe but I am and I would like to make the case that nuclear fusion will be that point that the bridge that T Boone Pickens talked about will get us to so nuclear fusion as our Energy Future and the second point making the case that kids can really change the world so you may ask how do you make well how do you know what are energy future as well I built a fusion reactor when I was 14 years old that is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor I started building this project when I was about 12 or 13 years old I decided I want to make a star now most of your probably saying oh well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion why don't see any nuclear power plants with Fusion Energi well it doesn't break even it doesn't produce more energy out than I put in but it still though some pretty cool stuff and I assembled Us in my garage and had no lives in the physics department of the University Nevada Reno and its lands together Duty which is just hydrogen with an extra Neutron in it so this is the similar to the reaction the proton chain that's going on inside the Sun and I'm slamming it together so hard that that that hydrogen fuses together and in the process at the house some byproducts and I utilize those byproducts so I this year I won the Intel international science and engineering fair I developed a detector that replaces the current detectors at homeland security has for her some dollars I fill up the system that exceeds the sensitivity of detectors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars I don't this you know she's in my in my garage and I've developed a system to produce medical Isotopes and still require multimillion-dollar facilities I've developed a device that on a very small scale can produces I stoop so that's my Fusion reactor in the background there that is me at the control panel of my Fusion reactor oh by the way I make yellow cake and my garage so my nuclear program is his advances by Iranians so maybe you don't want to admit to that this is me at CERN in Geneva Switzerland which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world and this is me with President Obama showing him Homeland Security research so so in in about seven years of doing this research I started out with a dream to make a star and a jar a star in my garage and I end up meeting the president and developing things that I think can change the world I think other kids can too so thank you very much this is the old Royal Naval College in Greenwich the world's most Americans let's be honest no but blowing up if you build nuclear in the basement of the 17th century building just miles from the center of London series the king building nuclear reactor so if a nuclear-free Zone Social Security can you claim to be scary only about what is float invented like I said I'm supposed to be empowered by the things you sent anything for David the process of creating electricity using nuclear power begins with the splitting of uranium atoms in the reactor this process called fission produces heat in a Boiling Water Reactor the water surrounding the nuclear fuel is turn directly into steam in the reactor vessel the steam is then transferred by pipes to the turbines spin turbines Drive the electric generator to produce electricity after the energy from the steam is used to spend the turbines it is drawn into condenser where does Kool and condense back in the water and pump back to the reactor to be boiled into steam again up close and still dangerous chernobyl's reactor for the scene of the total meltdown 25 years ago exactly the crisis that scientists in Japan have been battling to avoid the Jets if it was and Remains the world's worst nuclear accident dozens of people were killed from among them soldiers hold it to the front line if they clean up a quarter of a century on we would give an extremely rare access into the contaminated react to block but only briefly I didn't special clothing and fie must remain inside the radiation reabsorbed risk a funny moments with passage of time means levels are much better now except GP tried to concrete in Teens React at the melted core itself and this is the control room of react to full the play are the men who are running it. Say we're working on for a while they knew that something was going wrong but they didn't realize that would be nice if explosion in the night 50 meters away on the whole reactor within meltdown unit for is an eerie place in Poquoson radioactive debris is still not properly contained it remains a threat to the wider World it looks better for the outside than the inside if you're able to go to the central Hall today and look at you would find that there's holes the size of picture windows at various locations in the object shelter it sits up it's a problem that needs to be done with the structure will gradually be completed with expensive plans to build a boss this would find me a hundred years containing any radiation if the reactor building collapse the city of pripyat from which 50,000 people flooded in afternoon is still contaminated under bonding Andre kindergarten where my children Steve Wright City buildings for my friends is to leave some of them are no longer with us so this is this is emotional this is this a set sign of the 20-mile exclusion Zone around the react to being lifted a reminder that when you care how it goes wrong it can go very badly wrong Daniel Sandford BBC News Chernobyl after 19 years in construction it's time to fire up Japanese revolutionary Fusion machine tense moment flickering images of milestone in The Hundred-Foot clean Boundless Energy in case behind a hundred ton concrete wolf is the Colossal Sten only a handful of Stella ratings of being attempted you completed but not as big as complex as the Mendel Stein a7x is Hope this device will be a major game-changer conventional nuclear power stations generate energy the tremendous amount of hazardous waste for a long time since I believe you can a fusion to be the greenest fusing together popsicles at Xtreme 10 no easy feat The Raid 2 takes its inspiration from the Sun a mixture of readily available gases are heated to a hundred million degrees CS go hunt that awesome spray coupon for me it's super flowing ions and electrons these particles of an accelerated when they can Line Station immense energy keep the soup it's suspended in a powerful magnetic cage physicist hoping feature point when they get more energy out that they need to put in but that still decades away. It's a promise you sir you have to feel awkward if we achieve everything to put all the elements together to make fusion happen then we have in abundance CO2 neutral climate neutral energy source of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan the German government promised to phase out or conventional can a power plant in the next seven years but how safe is nuclear fusion this is more like an order if that's better than If you eliminate keep the fire going what has to happen all the time the gas in an experiment place no more than the posted stop seeing if it would nothing as well as Leaders Wrangle over the best way to tackle climate change scientists here acoustic never Chapman the final step closer towards the dream of Limitless power need for couches hold the first explosion blew out the top part of a reactor containment building at the Fukushima number one Nuclear Power Plant this footage inside the building was taken during a regular inspection the nuclear reactor is housed behind this basketball this is what a nuclear reactor looks like the uranium inside the fuel Rod inside the reactor undergoes spearfishing the rods emit heat generating energy usually water cools them to maintain their temperature at 270 degrees Celsius but if the cooling fails the temperature could rise to over 1200 degrees this temperature is hot enough melt the fuel rods when the earthquake hit first safety system to prevent a meltdown with activated control rods Rose into the reactor to stop the nuclear fission as planned the reactor stopped operating but the fuel rods were still hot water should have been circulated to cool them though however this didn't happen because of a power outage right after the Quake so II safeties turn off the emergency diesel-powered generator begin spring the rods with coolant but an hour later some unexpected happened without warning the emergency generator stopped around this time did tsunami possibly why is 10 meters if the power plant experts think this is what cause the generator to fail now food safety system started operating it converts a steam traveling to the pipes into water it cools the rods but the water level went and the temperature continue to rise all three safety measures had failed Professor Akita Emoto of the Japan atomic energy commission was involved in construction of the Fukushima plant thinks the cooling water leaked from the reactor gets it on with a double ee go somewhere in the building medications for a to Nami good what happened was beyond our expectations to forcibly Kool the reactor water had to be pumped into it and the containment vessel similar failures and a huge explosion also had another reactor at the plan on Monday once again Nature has challenged man's best efforts Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant in Buchanan New York we are immediately struck by the huge domes that in case it's reactor it we also can open Otis security you can't just roll on insecurity here extremely tired just filled out a few forms given our drivers license gotten several IDs guns for vehicles taking out all of our equipment inspected it and now we're ready to head on in the nuclear reactors that is after 2 things and more Security checks finally we head to the containment Dome of reactor number 3 which is currently off-line for refueling right now it's over right now so I'm going to be filling out if it's a little surreal like walking onto a movie set but instead of passing wooden props we passed through a very 11 foot thick concrete and steel wall this is actually the thickness down here this Yellow Tape warning of radioactive Danger all that separates us from the white uniform technicians doing the refueling replacing the spent fuel rods with new ones using a huge frame there lifted from the nuclear core and turn horizontal so they can move along a water-filled kanal2 the adjacent building with the spent fuel rods are kept in the pool to cool down here for some reason there were a problem say natural disaster and attack whatever this temporary plug is ready to go there giant forklift right behind it and it's all set within 15 minutes the plug can be shoved in there to protect the reactor this area are equipment shoes and body's getting scanned for any radiation we may have picked up we're good like a scimitar keeping track weed zero now we had to wear those spent fuel rods are kept passing through hallways and upstairs to make her way into the adjacent building entering the spent fuel Rod area we see the pool with its greenish tint it's about 40 feet deep and surrounded on all sides with 6 feet of concrete what is continuously pumped into the pool keeping it at a relatively cool 100 degrees Fahrenheit compared to the 2100 degrees nuclear fuel reaches for a meltdown to keep in the power on here is essential to a hurting disaster in a plexiglass and close case brand new wait their turn for a swim to the nuclear reactor core so how many have been there right now the fuel assemblies compose the fuel rods right as precise as the underwater refueling operations are they are not Indian Point reactor number to there's a leak since 1993 that officials say releases as much as 8 gallons of contaminate water a day during refueling you haven't been able to determine the source of Italy we haven't found the exact location to leave to be able to do the repair to stop if it's can't pinpoint the leak but your pilot VP of operations says it does not pose a safety hazard since it's within the Reactor Core will just come out of the expense polsinelli have to be checked for any radiation have to go into these that's what you're saying like I checked out okay because Indian Point just about 25 miles outside New York City and New to fault lines there are concerns what happened in Japan do you think that is any possibility that it could never happen here there's a very slim very slim the odds that ever happened here anywhere near the magnitude we plan what we think is possible to happen and we plan for Allen chernoff CNN Buchanan New York it's a familiar sight in central New York the plume of water vapor rising from the 543 foot cooling tower at Nine Mile point clear station but few people get a chance to look inside the plant on the shore of Lake Ontario due to strict rules and tight security required by the present nuclear fuel plant operations are hidden behind concrete walls five feet thick I'm out to the larger of the station's two reactors shut down recently to load new uranium fuel the refueling must be done every two to sustain the nuclear reaction that keeps the plant on the out about 1500 Extra workers to the plant to do the refueling and conduct make it can only be done if a plant is offline the outage also provided a rare opportunity to see inside a strange-looking room all workers passed through tight security and radiation monitoring on their way into the plant workers also where the Senators truck or exposure to radiation depending on how heavy the radiation is where they are working the pager like devices might be monitored continuously technician in another part of the plant from the control room the radiation technician watches those workers on cameras dressed head-to-toe in protective suits and breathing filtered air the workers do maintenance on a big valve in the dry well the concrete structure that surrounds the if one of the dissenters and those employees reaches 80% of the maximum allowed that worker will be ordered to leave the area Chris can also friskin sounds that hallway stations if they've been in the contaminated area during the outage that have a concrete floor around the reactor is removed by overhead crane like massive pieces of a jigsaw puzzle this gives workers access to the reactor the 21 foot wide head of the reactor is unbolted set aside so workers can get inside when the reactor is running a nuclear reaction creates heat the boils water to make Steam out of control rods are inserted between the nuclear fuel bundles to stop the reaction reactor vessel is flooded to the top as a further Shield against the oldest of the 14 foot long fuel rods inside the react which I've been inside for 6 years I lift it out and moved underwater to an arrow if the spent fuel pool they will remain for another six years or so then new fuel bundles are moved into the reactor vessel it's an entry Dance Design By company Engineers to produce the optimum performance of the reacted if you were more than 1 million homes the people in charge of squishy my diet you have learned some of their challenges may be more difficult than they thought it looking into unresolved problems at the nuclear plant what they I had change that understanding of what's Happening inside two years ago members of the government panel released their final report on the accident it said look up manually stop the emergency cooling system for reactor 3 early on March 13th two days after the disaster but the latest findings from Tokyo the power company so that the cooling system had already stopped functioning and more than six hours before the findings suggest that fuel rods started melting earlier than 10 officials delete and more melted fuel would have dropped to the bottom of the containment vessel that makes the removal of the fuel more difficult than expected that goes also found more problems after the accident Crews use fire engines to inject water into reactor too but the water and may have reacted with the fuel inside to put hydrogen raising the temperature significantly and then sped up the Meltdown warning high voltage is deadly radiation can be to a nuclear fusion is pretty sweet the sun does it was some ridiculous amount of gravity with a double Fusion Stills and around or even close emu speed Labs universities do have some awesome ones many types of Farnsworth uses a pretty much as simplest and are extremely inefficient they are fairly common project for high schoolers kids and pretty much just project I've been postponing building one for a while but I finally just had to do it but charge grid ionizes the gas trip and electrons in accelerating the positive nuclei towards the center some of them together to form stable helium for which connect a neutron or photon with build one I started by getting a bunch of used High vacuum parts getting it new would cost a fortune to 6 inch stainless have asked an 8-inch CF flange ends will make the main chamber as well as a bunch of labels and caps in the window of the electrical for the pumping out using oil diffusion pump in a small mechanical pump throttling valve and regulator for Jeep. Row V 1.5 inches with the Cs / dogs into one and trolls with kf25 after cutting up to see if if I broke out the TIG welder only while the inside prevent virtual leaks after an hour of welding and another of grinding that's the main chamber done that we need a high-voltage supply I ended up just buying a cockroach Walton multiplier on eBay packing a neon sign Transformer there are a lot of ways to get 30 or 40 thousand volts at like 10 million Nigerian can be hard to get as an isotope of hydrogen that is prettier and possibly dangerous in the wrong hands I just mine after some approval and some signatures if you can get heavy water just electrolizing it will make you. Also made a neutron detector out of the Russian SI 1910 you better count for circus better together I put the window feed through and stuff on the chamber has a built-in accelerator great out of my phone because I didn't have the right size comes to looks awful I cleaned all the surf exposed to vacuum with acetone and other solvents oil specs or anything out gas it will spoil your back you have to put in the two halves together it finally looks like a reactor pump down and helium leak test there were none I got done to 59 military Justin mechanic around a hundred military put a thousand volts on the grid and saw some low energy plasma slickly Define diffusion pump then hook it up to the valve doesn't have a baffle I use the key on a blower trying to keep most of the papers out of the reactor about the car thing out of Oak to hold it then started putting all the stuff in the chamber sits on these blocks and the pump just hang the thermocouple Cajun encap didn't bother to use better gauge then out of the deuterium tank and regulator with some zip ties been put in the high-voltage system and make sure I had a really good ground we could easily be lethal if you do it wrong is really important as this tingle / X rays the neutrons are only slowed by hydrocarbons I think this thing's ready to fire up the chamber down then fired up the diffusion pump it didn't take long for the thermocouple after about 40 minutes to clean the chamber I turn the power supply 230 KV and started adding deuterium it sometime to the vacuum pump and needle valve but after some fiddling I got a nice looking Plasma Tulsa X-rays and neutron counts that's a really a lot make sure it was really Neutron emissions I put pure silver in from the wing and I took it off it was initially generated radioactive silver Isotopes decay of the cadmium that pretty much means the reactor works and really does diffusion like I said but it is a fairly high energy Nutrisource so I doubt it'll be very long before and actually use them too long it's a good project to get used to high vacuum Tech High Voltage stuff as it doesn't require much precision and they're pretty simple to build thanks for watching scribe if you want
