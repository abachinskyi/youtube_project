are a sadistic man hashtag USA and looks like as an hour getting a head start on their Trump takedown The Weeknd McCarthy started rolling down 50th Avenue under Sean Spicer mobile Podium shepherding in traffic a friend so we have breaking news out of Washington a president Trump has decided to fire effective immediately after director Comey the director will be replaced by somebody else the president's choosing I said this is the strongest sign to date in my opinion aside from the fact that the media has been slandering him and his family for more than a year aside from that this is the strongest evidence to date in opinion the Trump is not a member of the so-called new world order that he is not a member of the same club and Social Circles but the clintons are apart some of their backers who are wealthy International Bankers are a part of this is the strongest sign yet that Donald Trump wants a nun FBI and an FBI capable of doing its job without delay so very encouraging sign if you're an FBI agent this is good news for you especially if you have a disturbing information about the clintons that you've been forced to sit on or to be more you know delivered about then you should have to be so basically I think this is a very good sign I think this is a sign that Trump is taking control and he is continuing to drain the swamp as he promised voters this is so encouraging I'm going to go out and have a really good glass of wine I head out to lunch because this is just great this proves the other Trump is the real deal in my opinion and how grateful I am is not our president that that piece of garbage wrapped in the pantsy that deceptive liar and that person you chose the disgusting campaign manager and you wanted to nominate him as secretary of state so grateful I am that this woman is not our president that instead we have Donald Trump who appears to be draining the swamp thank you guys so much for watching stay tuned for more and if you want to

it up as if it's true completely transparent Donald Trump's tax returns are not like to see this be transparent and you'll start to see that he's not he says he's for the little guy but black people are dependent on the backs of little guy he's got a little guy for eminent domain or through not paying the contractor is that something the little guys have stuff so that my question is going to be about these Trump victims the reason the message you it's gotten better since Alex is a barn-burner an Article 2 weeks ago is there started talk about victims of trump being a victims of Trump Atlantic City before that it was conservative apostasies now it's actually easier for the little guy to build your business on the backs of Littleton insulting and his lying Ted he said he's like a slob and everything else with him today which is fairly on presidential that I think he should just ignore that. She wasn't worried about them not just ignore these two people he thinks are talking parrots in New Hampshire thanks for us and we going to the boxes hey look I tried to send a message along through downtown to be salvaged but now I got to get serious about sending something to the White House I want somebody who hurls personal insults or who goes and talks that philosophical differences say as it as a pro-life or with many pro-life candidates were very disappointed I was very disappointed today they didn't leave for five times to get it right they would have gotten it right the first time because the pro-life Community is of one mind on this punish the woman she is looked upon as in vic you know I moved on her you know she was moved on I know Nancy and I moved in her very heavily if I took her out Furniture shopping she wanted to get some furniture that some nice furniture did you know French I moved in her like a b**** but I couldn't get there and she was married then all the sudden I got the biggest phone ever she's totally changed girls hottest in the world if you are are you and I will love it maybe it's a different yeah that's it with a gold Houston Texas just kissing them it's like a magnet I just I don't even let you do it you can do anything whatever you grab by the pussy do anything so it's good if you don't fall out of the bus Mike Ford Gerald Ford remember hello how are you all right miss you too really really good right now. you are you ready beats up star let's go make me a soapstone absolutely well you better come on Billy don't be shy I'm sorry I should have can you get the middle that's better that's better had to take one of us as a date which way you're going to leave here okay okay you go you're finished okay I do want to ask you about James, you know him well and in fact the present suggested today that there could even be a tape if he's if he's treated types of his private conversation was with Comey might exist and the come we should watch out for what he leaks supposedly you know about that dinner cuz you were with him the day of the dinner with James, but was 27th of January and we are dumb hoes wonderful farewell ceremony for me which I'll never forget and Jen I spoke briefly before the ceremony and he mentioned that he didn't to White House have dinner with some the president and that he was uneasy with that because even compromising me even the Optics the appearance of Independence oh and I don't need him but the FBI said he was going that very night to the dinner to hear him why he felt he had to go well I think anyone who has a serving officer in in the government and your ass by the I think it's a special courtesy your difficult to hear the difficult position to refuse to go on some but I do know he was he was uneasy with it for the just for the the appearance of compromising the independence of the FBI which is a how would turn it in and are in our system what we're hearing from the FBI from are reporting contradicts with the president old Lester Holt present all that, was appealing for his job and at the same time that the present asked him you know I am I under investigation he said three times twice on the phone and once at that dinner no I can assure you were not under investigation knowing Jim Comey and most people who know him well say that he never said that to him he would not have said that to him I don't know what was actually said at the dinner wasn't there but I would find that very inconsistent with what I know of the gym call me more over anyone who's in a position that subject to Senate confirmation Presidential appointments Senate confirmation which is his mind was understand that you at the pleasure of and it would really be I think inappropriate and shortly and Jim's case out of character for him to ask to stay on I couldn't imagine doing that myself nor can I imagine him doing that either hey there I'm Chris Hayes MSNBC thanks for watching MSNBC on you would you want to keep up-to-date with the videos for putting out you can click subscribe just below me or click over on this list as he lots of other great videos
