We put halogen on the best way to describe you know this really nice really clean minimalist polygon wallpapers that say well this app lets you make them to Simply input any photo of gradient good algorithm and it pretty much creates it for you you can decide to increase or decrease the number of polygons on the screen which can give you either clean or most sophisticated look and they could do a couple of settings to play with you can tweak the color palette we couldn't recall the polygons behave with each other so that you use WhatsApp which judging by the download numbers should be quite a if you keep up basically makes it a lot smarter it lets you draw information from the internet into your conversations safe after second search tamme typing apps the breaking news the latest news off that subject if you type in and give her bringing gifts if you type it out with you use Wikipedia in Bay City bring out if somebody offer research pretty cool the next up is an application that I've been waiting for my entire life on this is Waka Flocka once installed every time you're just the volume one muffin English straight to Justina media volume and it makes so much more sense in the default Android option because it's very rare that people actually want to change the notification for me what changed it the incoming messages since the next application which is kind of link to the last one is doing less and again it's so it's a very simple problem but what it does is went to screen it'll stop notification sounds from happening which makes a lot of sense because when you're using a small fence you're already getting pop-up notifications when things happen so it doesn't need to make it Stone buzzing noises and talk about rolling in at number five we go to screenshot utility and it's nothing revolutionary but it's a basic tool that allows you to edit and put him in any way you are to all the screenshots you take you can draw over them you cannot boxes circles and one of my favorite features is ability to blood things to bring Focus to suck and post screen you can let the rest of it so they may call me and this is not just another wallpaper app if that's your carefully selected community of artists Regio learning if you posting the outlets exclusively on the app so those results some really high-quality stuff from all over the world have you come in and the stuff you call industrial stuff you put colorful miso soup high-resolution looks great on my smoking friend displays and mostly quantity of wallpapers in this house on other wallpaper apps the quality of the content is hyzaar CNET next up by control and this is not your writing you out but I just discovered it recently I have to say is probably the best sideswiping control mechanism I've ever I said this but it's ridiculous not to customisation and it's very easy to activate its response if I don't need it if you simply swiping from the left or the right side or the top when is Anna brings up a little navigation circle on the radio something about pie control the reason that it's not even more functionality as competitive is that it responds differently depending on what you hold your phone the second coming will you let go you can overlay across any application and continually save you quite a lot of time the next up, and there's an icon pack on one of them the ones on the market so that it could have slightly faded slightly dark if you kind of remind me of wreck to recover a little bit it comes bundled with a lot of similar 15 wallpapers tomorrow fun to use Skies very have it doesn't my best Android apps for January 2017 if you do the video be sure to smash that like button if it is sent me a really long time with that being said I'm still usable and I'm signing up love you Mom I need some music.

Yeah let's hope it stays that are not like I said if she wasn't comfortable for you in the very very near future now there's a couple of reasons why they will be back free weapons coming very very soon now the normal. Time we have between getting DLC weapons is only 4 to 6 weeks I believe the old type of Contraband to the November Contraband was walking sticks weights never lost DLC content that we got was actually three and a half weeks ago I saw as of January the 6th day there was a smaller Lotte in Black Ops 3 no one has any other day they stopped I can find a swine only using the post we get 22 updates like this and then eventually get like a big update coming to gigabytes and then not the week later we'll get new DLC weapons on Saints Row 2 the Lost DLC constantly. Which included let the height chair legs and the cupboard above the gums that was three and a half weeks about how you're getting close. that way we could be seen DLC comes out very very soon bring the whole week since it's the last day of she comes and looks at me know when you get it every 4 to 6 weeks roughly from everything there yet that is reasons why I think we could be seeing delfi contact coming in the next couple of weeks. If you guys didn't know this weekend right the whole weekend is double cryptokey weekend which why do they know when take me to a couple of weeks before DLC contact comes out if always done in the past couple weeks and 4 days he comes it comes out just give people a chance to go on that letter k they can of food supply drops when new DLC comes it comes out I think it's about me being about 5 times before before DLC content come out a couple weeks beforehand with her. 50k weekend so if we going with the trend head yet probably sometime we could potentially see some new DLC content and upcoming week that I think that might be turn baby coming he doesn't know with the last update for weeks ago this change way if you own a DLC weapon that you haven't unlocked it was blanket was just talking out loud to the right of that weapon now probably cuz I didn't update and it now has the symbol of the Soviet navy and then we go to the black market on the contract as you can see that that is the same symbol for this could be a possibility of something I didn't say you could be I'm looking at DLC in contracts I cannot be pretty cool it looks like it will be heading down that route with at emblem kind of solo yeah that is going to back up stairs video DLC is coming within the next couple of weeks old is master lock button download if you are hot for that and if you want since I don't get why I'm actually just not that I'm coming down below how'd you guys next week I hope you got something about I think we might maxed out Malone's videos right he should check it out seriously good

remix video what's going on Snowville it's the best and worst of January took a little bit to recover from it that's why I feel it that stinks knowing first well the first thing you're going to say is so where's all these Oscar movies that came out in it figures the founder came out in December women release date do not qualify on this list if they came out of their eligible for Oscars you're not going to see him this list I don't write it in the thing the best and worst of January are the movies that came out in a wide release only in January and there were some turds hey we got a winner too we got a winner we got somebody coming back to prominence and knows best William January really when I go to so I can go to be on the sequel it is fantastic if not seen it yet check it out before summer Frozen for you Sean I really like the visit this is him proving that he's still got his fastball I hate doing it but I have to push in size but also for me because there are no other good movie and nothing else is good everything else are you had to agree with me I'm sorry everything else thinks I mean look at all these movies and I didn't well that's all it is it's January questions what do I pick as the worst one disappointed for this particular video I'm disappointed we did not see monster yeah I know but I'm glad I avoid that it was very good I did like I did that Resident Evils was stinky real stinky Dog's Purpose not so great and I feel all the behind-the-scenes stuff that came out that it's hard to enjoy that movie plus it if I think you're taking that one right on the world very good but it was probably one of the better ones are the ones I saw but you know it's funny and you originally I was going to take Resident Evil on my work but I'm not going to xXx XXX really bad it and I mean it's hard for me to say wishy washy wishy-washy today the worst one I'm sorry I sorry for the new just thought about how Ruby Rose the only thing didn't like in John Wick in the show
