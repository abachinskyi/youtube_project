the gateway to another world is here and it only cost $200 I'm Scott Stein maybe that sounds a little grin but you've heard of ER virtual reality isn't everything from the Oculus Rift to Sony's Project Morpheus and that technology involves you plug into a PC or console but you can plug your phone is well Google cardboard show that it could be done and now here is the first one that you can really buy that's a rig this is the Samsung Gear VR and is $199 accessory available only in the US for now that works with just one phone the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is really just a bracket for it open up this here you plug in your phone right at the top and it takes advantage of the Note 4's 5.7 inch Quad HD display inside there are two spherical that bend everything and suddenly turn what you're saying into an immersive 3D experience and what happens in VR will imagine you put the time and then suddenly you see perhaps a 3d concert somebody playing a guitar and you're sitting in their living room you can look at them up down all around it's everywhere behind you has built an accelerometer the tracks head motion it doesn't allow you to do full head tracking like some of the more advanced virtual reality rigs she can't bend down an Explorer the space but you can turn around and all directions like this and use a touchpad on the side to navigate or pair Bluetooth polar to play games with only a handful of apps and they all run through an Oculus app that allows you to download the experiences they're all free and they rein from games to panoramic photos and videos and immersive theatrical experiences what you feel like is that you're immersed in that space But the experience is a little bit Limited because even though the screen resolution on that phone is fantastically dense when its expanded out and virtual reality and begin to see the pixels individually and video or a little more low-res than you might expect still that immersive pneus create something that's more eye-popping than I think I've ever seen before and I've shown this to so many people to my family friends a lot of the tech experience cynics out there and nearly everybody is more often than not blown away by the experience and I can't think of anything since the debut possibly the iPhone that's creative technology so futuristic that everybody wants to line up and try it out we don't know how many more apps Apple support on the road but hopefully with the Oculus partnership this is developed in collaboration with oculus that you're going to see a lot of stuff down the road where you get $499 as you get this headset you also get a Micro SD card 16 gigs is loaded up with some other experiences that you can put on it and you get this carrying case but if you have a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 that seems like a really good treat to yourself to just dive in and have fun with it provided you want to play around with VR there will be a lot of virtual reality Tech coming up in B15 from a lot of different companies new types of input ways the you can reach out and explore and this limited set may not fully go there but it is anime First Step you want to be in a virtual movie theater swim in an aquarium explore the solar system play Virtual Arcade games that are floating in front of you and more does Samsung Gear VR is the first available and right now it's definitely the best 

imagine a virtual reality experience where when you go with his vet reality world everything looks like it's real and you can navigate around it and begin to do Jordan everything's in this High Fidelity world at home you will have yourself 3D scanned down to the millimeter I then enter into virtual world and I have an AI there that is my shopping advisor it says Peter what you looking for and all of a sudden in this virtual world everything I see is in my size in the colors I want recommended by this and I can say you know I'd love to see a fashion show on a Runway are out stars of me wearing all these different outfits walking by and I can say I want I want to see that one and that one and all of a sudden I'm looking in a virtual mirror and I'm wearing that outfit and I can look around see what it looks like to go this is it I want that boom it's produced manufactured to my exact size 3D printing capabilities or robotic capabilities that afternoon in the local Factory and delivered the next morning and it fits perfectly so that's the future of the virtual retail store if you would and why I think virtual reality is going to do effectively a hundredfold Improvement of what the Amazon experience is today

virtual reality is undoubtedly one of the coolest things to exist the thought of wandering around in Wonderland when you want great but have you ever thought of how this would affect your brain virtual reality maybe becoming a big thing in gaming however some of you may be shocked to know that it's also some waves in the world on Urology especially when it comes to understanding the brain in 2014 researchers at UCLA conducted a study to learn about the brains react go to Virtual Reality the study involved the researchers placing Rats on treadmill surrounded by screens projecting a virtual world in a dark quiet room and observing the rat's brain while observing the brain activity of the rats the scientists noticed something strange in the hippocampus the hippocampus is an important part of the brain which plays a role in forming new memories creating spatial maps of an environment when a person explores an environment the neurons and the hippocampus become active creating a cognitive map of the environment the HIPAA Marcus can also estimate distances between the person and surrounding landmarks through other cubes like smells and sounds when the rats are placed in the virtual world the researchers want to see play hippocampus would behave without being able to use Q's to just smells and sounds when does I just looked at a result they found the hippocampus is reactions to the real world and virtual world were different wait what in the virtual world then you're on seem to Fire and completely random sequences this imply the hippocampus had no idea where the rat was despite the fact that's Behavior seem normal even more surprising was a fact that even though the neurons of a rat's hippocampus were highly active in the real world more than 50% of the neurons were shut down the virtual Spider-Man however the team didn't just study individual neurons they also studied large groups of hippocampal neurons which is shown by previous studies create complex rhythms Witcher show for learning and memory runs in the hippocampus communicate with each other using two different languages based on Rhythm and intensity the researchers noted that in the virtual environment the spaced on rhythm is similar to that in the real world however the language based on intensity is completely disrupted however virtual reality doesn't just allow us to understand the hippocampus Morton also use it for cognitive Rehabilitation for those who suffer from brain injury VR can be used as a means of cognitive evaluation by evaluating users perform sing very stimulated environments for cognitive therapy improvements in memory and attention were noted it's nice to see how we are as being game change your outside the world of gaming hopefully we are will help make more breakthroughs in the field of science since its applications are virtually no pun intended unlimited and before couldn't raise last night ask you how do you think VR should be used in science if you enjoyed this video leave a like and share it so others can learn too and don't forget to subscribe remorse science videos

virtual reality devices are becoming more and more common letting people explore Digital World by being in movies or games this also means more people might experience virtual reality sickness or cybersickness a lot like motion sickness with symptoms like disorientation headaches and feeling like you have to what seem to happen when your senses disagree about whether or not your move there certain problems that are unique to VR so those are what researchers are really trying to fix some of the causes of VR sickness limit to the technology for head but the computer doesn't twig the virtual world right away that's a latency issue or the world might flicker because the screens aren't updating quickly enough which is um with the refresh rate companies are working on these things with each new device but a lot of people still get VR sickness because their brains are getting conflicting signals from their senses so researchers from the Mayo connect created something to trick your brain into thinking your body is moving normally the vestibular system in your inner ear detect movement with fluid and sensitive hair cells and send that information through terms to your brains technology called galvanic vestibular stimulation use a small electrodes on a person's head to send tiny electrical pulses and stimulate those same nerves who are they move in the virtual world on these pulses seemed to do the trick the brain thinks it's seeing and feeling movement and people using the system seem to get VR sickness less off however other I think there might be a simpler solution when I hear from Columbia University engineer's involved shrinking and user's field of you when they moved quickly in a virtual world it's kind of similar to focusing on a distant object to help with Insignia close objects of the edge of your vision seem like they're moving faster than object that are far away and in front of you I suddenly blocking the edge of your vision the virtual move it might not seem as jar other scientist from Purdue University of found that a large virtual nose at the bottom center of the screen can help they aren't exactly sure why it works but having a stationary thing in your view your nose in real life might just make you feel more stable plus it's preparing us for smell-o-vision most of these studies are pretty small so it'll take a lot more research to figure out how to help everyone who gets VR sickness but pretty soon you might be able to fly spaceships to Virtual Galaxy's without wanting to hurl after work thanks for asking and thanks especially to all of our patrons on patreon who keep these answers coming if you'd like to sneak questions to be answered or get some videos a few days early just go to patreon.com / oh and don't forget to go to youtube.com show And subscribe how about sensory conflict meaning your central nervous system is receiving completing information from Kaiser years sensory receptors in your Spine & Joint 

we feel like virtuality is going to be the one of the next biggest things in gaming and Computing there's so much Buzz around it in the industry right now focused on helping to deliver that next-generation virtuality Graphics platform so the first part of that is building the world's fastest and best GPS with are GeForce GTX graphics the second component is a client software GeForce experience which helps Gamers get the latest drivers and the right optimal settings for their VR games and applications Western component is are GameWorks in the arse DK which helps headset and game developers get better performance lower latency and better compatibility for their VR games and applications Sarah 5 features as part of our Gameworks PRS Decay the first feature is called VR SLI and is everyone knows that's a lie as a way to use multiple GeForce GTX GPU LL Tisdale performance with VR we can have one GB renew the right eye and one GPU render the left eye to improve performance for virtual reality Games second future is what we called multi res shading so it normal rendering your drawing a rectangle image like a desktop monitor looks like but within virtual reality or actually a drawing to all shapes that are distorted based off of the Optics that are used in the headset and remote there is shading developers can you special Hardware inside of are GeForce gpus to render only the pixels that show up in the final distorted image and thereby save anywhere from 20 to 50% of the pixels John so 30 is help reduce latency by updating the image that's been rendered based off of the latest position of your head the fourth feature is called from before rendering in this is another technique for reducing Steve in virtual reality we can render directly to the frame that is being output to the display scanning the image out as soon as it is war nearby reduce latency is what we call Direct mode which allows for plug-in play compatibility between headsets and GeForce space to Casey's today when you plug in set Windows treats it like a desktop monitor looks then your desktop onto that display but with direct mode and place the treats it like a VR headset see only get your VR game applications on not in it really delivers much better experience for working with the leaders in the industry including CCP epic vald HTC 10 and grade some of these features and help deliver better and virtual reality experience for gamers awesome to see so much work on together in such a short. Of time RTC an incredible games like Eve Valkyrie and Elite dangerous and Technology demos like Showdown and back to Dinosaur Island video we're super excited about the food turn a virtual reality and gaming working hard to bring you guys the best experience possible with our GeForce GPS or Gameworks PR software development kit in GeForce experience

free movies in virtual reality seemingly have nothing to do with each other but they fold surprisingly similar past both have been mostly confined to novelty you since like the snake that jumps out of the screen at you at something kids to Disney World and virtual reality has basically just been for video games and sex scenes in Sci-Fi movies were recently though both made a move toward the mainstream they've been tapped to do roughly the same thing even make our movies games and the whole Digital World much more immersive both are even designed to replicate how it is we see the world different stance when you look at the world through your actual eyes they see two slightly different pictures because your eyes are set apart your brain matches them into one which is how you perceive depth accurately that's also why catch Spa with only one eye open is really hard 3D cameras do the same thing and if they capture to images that they been projected to your separate eyes you use other anaglyph swear one eye sees a red image in the other Seas blue or polarized glasses which pick up late being projected into different directions and pipe them into each eye there's also active shutter 3D Auto rheoscopic 3D which is just a fancy way for saying the screen does all the work and you don't need glasses and plenty of other options they all rely on your brain to take two distinct images and turn them into one it's really has play caught on now at least not among consumers and everyday people it's difficult and expensive to do right it still requires that you sit with your head very still and at a very particular angle and there are huge turntable for home and either doesn't work at all or actually makes them sick the technology is still changing and it's going to continue to improve but here's the thing virtual reality might eat lunch before virtual reality also been around forever it's also been gimmicky for most of that time and is only recently threatening to become something we use in our day-to-day lives on one hand it has a lot of the game limitations is 3D you have to do another thing and it can be really disorienting for some people but when done right virtual reality brings the immersion to an entirely new level it's all about exploration good virtual reality creates a three-dimensional world that doesn't just appear to have deck it has death an object will look different depending on how you look at it and you can eat see it from the back you can't do that with a 3D camera please simply reality works by Trucking what are called Place cells in our brand these cells are ants in a new environment there how we figure out where we parked or even the house and surprising once were a new environment these cells make it really easy to figure out where we are even if we've been are just a short time but virtual reality has its own complications and challenges but it's reality to feel real there has to be zero latency when you turn your head you need to be looking to the side exactly as fast as you expect and they lack takes you out of the experience and if what does a catches up can be so disorienting that you can actually get sick and these Place cells need information like smells and temperature to really give you a full sense of where you are both virtual reality are still maturing but they're both moving towards the same goal we want our movies to feel like video games and are video games to feel like real life in virtual reality bring the change 3D promise and just how far into the Matrix can we really go

virtual reality is a way to immerse people in alternative worlds so we use goggles that transport people to entirely different Universe a different planets different environment places that we've never seen or been before maybe even never imagined before we meet patients where they are come to their hospital room and are we fit them with the goggles make sure they're going to Snug and comfortable then we bring them through the video experiences one video brings people Iceland where they get a helicopter and they can explore these unbelievable topographies II video is an art studio which is an opportunity for just to sit back and drop hankton the third video is great for people that love the water and love the sea they can swim with dolphins and with sea creatures blue whales takes about 20 minutes of time and then afterwards we sit down and find out what they thought of it and it's been a little time learning from them so what we're doing here is part of a Ranger initiative to find out how to use digital Technologies to improve the value of Care at Cedar-Sinai and Beyond and buy Valu we mean we want to the quality of care in the experiences that are patients have but also reduce the cost of care and something like virtual reality might be able to do that by reducing the resources that are used for tanning the length of stay that people spend in the hospital and as a result improve their overall experience and reduce resources the same time our goal is to not just do this but to analyze it to study it in to publish it and to disseminate what we're learning to the rest of the health-care world so that are doing here at Cedars-Sinai could be a model for others to follow 

that's the name we are addicted to you stuff I want to touch that thing we like to talk the audience in different ways we like to surprise people when something like VR shows up of course you want to get involved I love it virtual reality is not realistic super authentic and that's exactly what we wanted to achieve with Koreans Felix and Paul Studios is solely focused on the creation of virtual reality experiences we needed to identify moments inside of the show that we believe could come together to create a great virtual reality experience cider making history to record the experience we were using our proprietary Recording Technology that recordes images Matt's Rancho 60 degrees in 3D was on the stage so he was great to play around it so I having an audience member on the stage with us what I'm looking for the work was to concentrate on one viewer without diminishing the level of energy and vitality the viewer is the new some that arrives in the cabin after zatista viewer will get to experience very intimate and private moments and also Randy elsmore missed the modulation between those moments will create a very special emotional Journey we're just at the beginning of exploring new ways to tell

on a reality check segment this week we take a look at how Ford's using virtual reality in motion capture technology true or find a manufacturing process outfitting their employees with immersive graphic headsets and motion capture bodysuits for creates and virtual environments in which to simulate the assembly about coming models years in advance job one such as the new F-150 pickups the data collected is used to design tooling for the assembly line which not only makes the job easier and safer for workers but sobaks design of vehicle components and parts to streamline assembly 3D printing is used as a tool here such as in the study with the 2015 F150 engine transmission mating process which one point was a matter of concern for engineers they simulated the process in the virtual world running through the steps with a real send a 3D printed mock-up and the digital realm seen in the headset this enabled in the South keep process and design issues years ahead of actual assembly the process is used for studying the bill process of all new Ford vehicles to solve both production challenges through design as well as make the moves an action safer and less stressful on the the line workers most importantly Ford says this program is actually reduce employee injury rates by as much as 70% and that that's a very dang 

one of the things that we realized with my father was that it was all about loss the loss of his high and the Lost spa at the loss of activity in the loss of interactivity with other people so when I had the opportunity to get involved in the and see what that could do totally people that bring can I really wanted to contribute something that would make a difference to people's lost time was that facilities were very comfortable everything but it wasn't enough and that's where we as it is a PR Company sort opportunity to bring that fun and had to bring that joy to those that have limited Mobility some that can leave the the residence wave the room since we've been having Solace at the Boulevard Racine rest it's really joyful they have station activity that you maybe wouldn't expect an old person to enjoy but we're seeing people responding to trouble diocese to slaps to the beaches on the way I can share it with the harmless and with star so if I we've had some really good salt was here at the Boulevard and putting together all of those are positive responses is pushing out case to hang out with your old all just love the interaction with the residents when using a day descriptions of just saying unbelievable 

doesn't want a vibrating reality skateboarding simulator yes. Yuki Santo out the Tokyo Institute of Technology has built this amazingly involved board game this is brilliant because the stapled is vibrating can you hear the difference the the it lets Riders feel the ground text to change beneath their feet as if they were skateboarding on real best because I'm in touch we have a safe I can get all the Frills of my speed riding in real life with none of the consequences when I fall of inevitably into the scenery experience things in the same way wow wow that's pretty incredible I think that since we haven't really talked bring a game like this to life the song how's the feeling of the vibration and suddenly the actual physical and I didn't think I would need to get the sounds they mounted microphones underneath wheel skateboard send the sound for each texture is played back during the game depending on the text being displayed on the screen repair of bass speakers it basically it's using sound but low frequency sound to give vibration and then I hear termite control is a computer it's a very ambitious project but it does kind of work the system also recognizes when you skateboard computer generated ocg will respond accordingly plus as a sensor in the treadmill inveterate metal detector kitchen 4th and then the computer simmer 8:35.
