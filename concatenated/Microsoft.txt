coming up I'll take you on a tour of the new Surface dock including key aspects of its design what you can connect to it and how you can use it multiple monitors with the new Surface dock we were the create a single doc that can be used across the largest range of surface devices I happen to be docked with a lispro for here but it works great with the surface book as well as the Surface Pro 3 surface dock features Microsoft's own magnetic surface connecting interface this is a full-featured doc when cable connects everything and you don't have to connect a second cable they would occupy a USB port in fact this one cable replaces all of these unless look more closely at the design the first thing you will notice when you pick up a surface dock how solid it feels to design for use while you're at your desk it's weight design with a soft High Fortune rubber foot prevent the surface dock from sliding around even if you accidentally pulled a surface from the dock cable I'm taking a closer look at the cable what unique about the cable is the size and flexibility is a two-year journey to design a whole new cable system that was both thin and flexible it's able to carry audio video ethernet and high speed get up and up to 60 watts of power because it's flexible it doesn't get in the way when your surface is Doc you can use your surface in any position if we take a look around at what's available on the dock the first thing you might notice is we don't have for high-speed USB 3.0 ports for your surface what do on the front and two on the back this allows data transfer is up to five you get bits per second and provides up to 7.5 watch power on each port as you'd expect there's also a gigabit Ethernet port a 3.5 mm stereo output Jack and a security lock slot to prevent theft the new Surface dock also adds another DisplayPort in order to support two external displays without the need to daisy chain these can be connected directly to two HD displays one 4K display at 60 hertz or 4K display is running it up to 30 hurts each which makes it easier for you to connect two monitors this covers most workplace Mario's today and what this much green real estate you cannot get more done for best performance we recommend monitors with Native display for it input if you're using monitors with HDMI or DVI input and recommend using active adapters a list of supported DisplayPort monitors and adapters can be found at the link below so that's the new Surface dock tell us which thanks so we can continue to give you the best docking experience also keep checking back from more demo benches on the surface design and management thanks for watching

you know the Microsoft Surface tablets they're pretty good not only for the form factor but also the optional keyboard to pick up like the touch or type covers I doing this most recent Mobile World Congress mugshot pronounce several key things such as the Lumia 640 and its 6:40 but introduce one new accessory hey guys John B from phone when you're watching our video review of the Microsoft foldable keyboard Microsoft's influence with the design he has very similar to the touch and type keyboards that they make for the Surface tablets as president open up what does a full qwerty keyboard tactile check with balconies and that's the same material to as the touch and type keyboards you have this almost fabric material well it's still resist them which is good and some portable lightweight and thin when it's closed it's less than half an inch thick and a great part about it is that it tell the place to magnet so it's not flopping around the first now it has the chiclet-style keys so I'm not really raise kind of flush but of course when you start putting your fingers over the keys you can get a sense of good death with that there's good not travel with it and it's 107 quickie which is nice however though the thing we got to point out it's just getting adjusted to the actual layout self you can tell it's split right down the middle it cuts everything email Eric spacebar so at first we thought it a little bit tough trying to use the keyboard Pace was a lot slower of course but over time the more we use became pretty second nature and after while we're breezing through many passengers attacks with little effort they think it's worth pointing out about the Alexa mobile keyboard is that it's compatible to work with any Bluetooth device that means have an Android device and iOS and even a windows-based one snack no issues whatsoever you have a set of directional Keys here for Quick Navigation which is nice it could be paired to two devices so let's sit on the what do have it connected to your iPhone and at home you want connected to your Windows tablet you can do that quickly and jump between the 2 you have also a home button here so for touch devices when you press that you get to back to the home screen I don't have also of these set of dedicated buttons here like volume control you have your media functions even searched person that loves travel like the will appreciate what they much soft foldable keyboard has to offer its discreet compact does putting your backpack in your ready to go no worries whatsoever even better the battery life is excellent now we've been using this for well over two weeks now when we have just had me to actually charge it more points that it delivers up to 3 months of battery life with single charge which is pretty impressive so try to charge it's going to be some time before you're going to need to charge it again and if you do it's nice at the relies on a built-in battery disconnected to a micro USB cable and that no need to worry about buying you know replaceable batteries like double or triple A's right now $400 now that's pretty steep when you think of portable keyboards in general if you do quick search on Amazon you can find several ones that are priced less than this $70 or less from the names like Logitech and even the SAG the wild a cheaper than adventure with the mud soft foldable keyboard is its unique design compared to them this is just incredibly lightweight and super thin can you keep your match in that regard and slanted you have long battery life with that so if you prefer the design styling this we definitely recommend it but if it's too pricey one thing about the other options

what's a guy's Mike hear the Detroit Borg and today we're taking a look at these surface dial this is a Windows 10 accessory that is launched alongside the surface Studio but does work with Windows 10 device so Inside the Box will find the surface dial and it is all alone I'm so it's very similar to the other surface products it feels very nice and high quality and is nicely on the other side we'll find a sticker that explains how to set up the Bluetooth pairing process to connect this to your Windows 10 device now what you peel off that label you'll find a sticky surface allows the surface dial to be attached to a glass display like these surface studio now to get to the batteries and the pairing button you just remove the base and it is magnetic so it attaches really easy now these pre-installed to Triple-A battery so it's ready to go I have to do is press and hold the pairing button this will activate the pairing process after holding it for 5 seconds and you'll see an pretty light appear once it's ready to start pairing so what's your reinstall the base you just have to go to your computer and make sure Bluetooth is turned on and then you should see the surface dial ready to be paired I have to do is hit the pair button and you're ready to go now the first thing to know about the surface dial is that it can be used when it's a test of the screen or off the screen on a solid surface like you're deaf well the screen you do get on screen interface controls which you can reposition as soon as you attach the dial to the screen the on-screen interface sort of envelops the footprint of the dial and moves with it currently only the surface Studio supports this on-screen use but the student really needs to be in the drafting position otherwise it's we're just slowly slides off the I wish this was a little stickier because it does like to move around when you're using it and even in the drafting position it's still slides down now the dial can control a number of different tools to pay zombie app you're currently using so using the dial is fairly intuitive you turn left and right to navigate the menu scrub videos scroll a list zoom in and out or incremental judgments like adjusting volume or brightness you can also click the knob to make selections are long press to bring up the on-screen menu to select different tools to control you left and right turn of enough at least tools will change with the app currently on the screen so if you're on the desktop of Knob essentially turns into a volume controller but within apps you get more is work with so for example when you're within a video editor you can scrub your video by selecting these scrolling tool in the maps app we get tools for Zoom tilt and rotate how does deliver some haptic feedback for some tools to simulate detents and I find this a little too strong and it actually can be noisy because it vibrates while their surface you place it on but enter this off under settings now the primary role for the stool is really for Creative professionals so it's uniquely designed for those apps that the idea is to provide a secondary control mechanism while using the surface pen for drawing this allows you to change colors or width of your drawing tools on the Fly I can't really demonstrate this with these sketch app but it's something that's available in more sophisticated apps like Photoshop now there is a settings panel for this you'll find it under devices and it's under the wheel settings as long as you to assign or remove Vida fault tools for Beyond screen interface the Custom Tool can also be configured here as well this allows you to sign keyboard shortcuts for Left Right and click not for the most part this really is not in a tool really depends on what app you use most of all so for example if you're a creative professional as I mentioned earlier this provides a unique interface that you can get in any other system 4 day today use this really has limited usefulness because of course if you have a touch screen you can perform most of these actions with more granular control then just a dial already guys hope you enjoy this quick look at these surface dial if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up to let me know and I'll see you again in the next video
