Google highly value people who know how to handle ambiguity and navigate the space which is definitely not something that you learn in college it's something cool are doing and it's something that I was able to learn very well when I was an intern here so I went to school at Washington University in St.Louis where I studied psychology go to internet Google because I love challenging myself in new ways during my internship I got to work in AdWords and I quickly became the social media strategist on the my entire project was based on a single question how can Google better sell social media if not just about coming up with theoretical answers it's about coming up with real since I'm testing them so I've devised a social media strategy for a Cosmetic Company got to pitch it to their top Executives and ended up winning a three hundred polar pitch by the end of the summer currently I am an account manager within a bird's-eye work with small and medium businesses and I do account consultations really cool to hear someone play that without adverbs that they wouldn't have a business cuz it shows how much impact I have when I talk to them my advertisers are people who really taken a chance on something that they love is there a smaller medium business it feels like I'm truly touching people's lives and making a difference That Matters to them the people are just incredible here everyone has the cool sorry it's really inspiring just being around smart people is probably the best motivation to just become a better version of you there's constant internal opportunities without even having to leave the company you can try hundreds of different positions and I personally would never want to leave so I love both of us should I just think that the best place in the entire world to work I like so much love for Google it's really awkward
