hey guys it's Lauren good with the Verge and today we're at Amazon's ux labs in San Francisco taking a look at two new devices in the Waco family this is the new Echo. It works in some way so early to the big Echo now you can use the. As a speaker but you're probably not going to use as a speaker because it's not that powerful what you're really supposed to do with this thing is either parrot via Bluetooth or connect its you can see the line out here to a better speaker and then have all the capabilities of the echo through that speaker so just like you can say to the regular Echo you could say to the dot Alexa call me Uber or Alexa what were the results of super Tuesday and you would get a response but it would actually happen through your bigger better speaker hot goes on sale today and if costs 8999 there is no deal for Prime users however Amazon has put a twist into the ordering process right now you can only order one of these through an existing Alexa device so you either have to say to your Amazon TV Alexa order me a DOT or through the existing are speaker in order to get it right now that's not forever Amazon says eventually it will open orders up to everybody so there it is the new Amazon Echo. We also have a Hands-On can you Amazon Echo tap speaker so be sure to check that out on YouTube and also subscribe to our YouTube channel

is jet really better than Amazon let's put it to the test I'm Bridget Carey this is your CNET update many retailers dream of crushing Amazon but there's a brand-new shopping website that's actually taking on the challenge jet.com Tuesday it says it good not only beat Amazon's prices but it's scanning the web to offer the lowest prices from any site jet is a shopping club you have to pay $50 a year use the site and that's where it makes all its money Jets whole pitch is that the more you shop the more you save on some items that idea is that if the items are coming from the same warehouse It's British ship it together with your other items so it'll shave some money off your total you can also knock off a few cents of the total by waiving your right to return the item at a see if it was really play for the Amazon I took it for a spin all right let's see how this whole discount thing works let's do a little shopping I'm going here I need some household items lips pickups Clorox I'm saving $0.59 keep going to get some swiffers adding that two cards up okay getting some tristam savings alerts keep it going you know what I need some Dixie cups for the bathroom let's see okay I'll grab one of these at a cart I feel like I'm going to casino here I just keeps rolling the numbers I don't know what this even mean sorry it so far I'm saving $4.53 is it going you know what I need some socks no socks available at all okay so I can put on my journey and picked up a shower curtain my total price came to about $31 which was cheaper than picking out the exact same items from Amazon so yes Joe was Stark but there are a few other things you have to keep in mind Jets membership only gives you free delivery when you spend $35 or more and delivery from any household items is today's but some things could take 5 days I remember how it did so any socks the site has an answer for that call Jet anywhere if you use jet as a portal to another website like Macy's and then go shopping on there you can earn points to spend later on jet.com but to get the points you have to forward an order confirmation email back it's a huge hassle but it's part of the startups awkward growing phase and it's going to be a long awkward phase in fact it's losing money with some orders because it doesn't have carry many items yet so its employees are buying them on your behalf from other stores like Walmart and JCPenney and then shipping it to you that's the plan until I can secure more Partners the founder and CEO Marc lore said in interviews that it won't be profitable until it gets about 15 million members which may happen in five years but you might as well check it out now to see how works it's free to try for the first three months that's it for this Tech news update there's more to cnet.com from our studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey

Amazon Dash buttons may not click for everyone I'm Bridget Carey this is your CNET update last week Amazon began selling its New Concept for shopping at the touch of a button the Amazon Dash buttons a little plastic Wireless pods you can hang or stick anywhere in the home and the idea is that when you're running out of a certain product you would press the button to have Amazon autumn please ship more of that product to your door only Prime members can get these buttons and you have to pay for the privilege of having a button to press each cost $5 when they are decorated with the logo of a specific household brand there are 18 different Brandon buttons and I ordered 6 to try out tide glad Cottonelle change Gillette in Kraft macaroni and cheese because who doesn't need a mac and cheese panic button well as fun as it all sounds you may find yourself disappointed with the limitations which brand limits what type of product you can order with the button for example the one for Gillette only let you order men's razors there are 15 different types of Shaving you're going to sign to that button but none of her the Gillette Venus women's brown all of this is set up from your Amazon shopping app you think the button to your home Wi-Fi and then you're giving a list choices of what you want the button to order glad gives you 20 traces of garbage bags and there are 16 different types of mac and cheese including something called cheddar explosion I want with Ninja Turtle shapes all good things in a cheese crisis but before you buy a button the main Amazon website will show you the options of what the button can buy but you may come awesome glitch in the early days I picked a tide product that wasn't in the main list of options and Amazon said it is fixing that glitch as far as Choice Amazon says it is Centegra with selection and continuing to listen to customer feedback but if your tended to buy with a button make sure you live in a place where the postal carrier can leave the box at your doorstep otherwise if you're like me in an apartment you may have to go to the post office to pick up that large 24 pack of box of Bounty paper towels and it doesn't make sense when I can the store right away to buy it in person meanwhile there's been some Buzz online about Amazon changing its policy with Prime and how many people you can share it with currently you only share the perks of prime free 2-day shipping with one other adult and it better be an adult you love and Trust because that person now could also use your credit and debit cards that you am I file before cards were not linked at all and you could add for other adults to share your Prime Privileges and benefits cost $100 a year that's if it Tech news update and you can always get more news and cnet.com from our studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey same here everyday has made me definitely a hundred percent the Killer tell people about my experience here an Amazon I mean it's just it's the funnest roller coaster ride I've ever been on that's my whole experience from getting hired on and starting and pics getting promoted and now being a PA for Pick and all the opportunities that Amazon prison and you know being the first in California and the being a part of the first facility here it's all amazing honestly the main leadership principle that I always go back to is have a backbone disagree and commit if we don't express how we feel or if there's something that's making the process difficult to us we can fix it for our associate so always being able to speak our mind and give our suggestions and input parts of the process I think it's really important it gives us a voice and it also gives the associates avoid while my next step that I hope to reach is a area manager and I would like to stay and pick as an area manager I love outbound honestly from there the sky's the limit I come here every day with a smile on my face and I enjoy coming to work and I am name the things that I do I mean if it's evident all around the warehouse to we do work hard I'm working hard always comes first but we always make sure we have a little fun in there and women making history since we got here 

just over the other side this lake is one of the most elusive but one of the most fascinating creatures how are the Amazon river is known as long then longer than I am too hidden in the flooded forest and any second they could disappear before we have a chance to film anything on mine is getting to these animals before they just it's a long hard slog and finally we can hear them somewhere on the edge of the lake but it seems he remembers easy she that cools in the hotel John horses are incredibly rare it would be quite an achievement on a real privilege to see them up close stories when they finally emerge we all kaside ourselves after the warsat fading together is chest x-ray a group of animals so one of them has just made a kill and this still is brown chicken and I can hear and crunching from here I'm sweating like crazy I'm about it and I couldn't care less this is awesome connection if we seen them then they gone Vanishing into the flight forest and by the sounds of it something's kicking off this prolonged vehicle thing that's going on behind us is probably they also said found an anaconda sink or Caiman crocodile and just I really out of it it's like there's nothing that would mess with them tripping all the fuss is about

I really think if I but in the hole I can't get myself seriously in this dress who's going to be the talk of the dress that we see through but it's legitimately the whole thing was it sound like my child I am trying on what eBay and Amazon prom dresses I didn't figure like 4 weeks ago and you guys really liked it and asked me to phone and that's what I move you in today I did have a couple of requests show videos today is like trying on bikinis and trying on different stuff so if you want me to try anything else from eBay or Amazon tell me I really appreciate it if you haven't already could visit Sky button that makes you subscribe to save every single week I really curious I want to know what your favor change the news it's currently going in to Winter in Australia and Queensland so it's kind of warm anyway but I want to know what your favorite season is summer my birthday is in is definitely Soma I always with someone quarters like all year round older he has already following me on Instagram this is what my face looks like a proud of it look like stupid colorful I clearly Love cover photos I always reply to comments or come say hey sore like I'm waiting but anyway didn't see my last year I'm going to do a kind of similar to that so I can get to you kind of like up Sarah if you didn't say that basically I went in and I said well address look like where can I order vitamin quality at a 10 and a lovely I went in and said whether or not I'd whether that's kind of how I'm going to judge these dresses what is from eBay I know you wrote it on the package thanks I think please see if it can be massive fail it's good lace on the top and is completely see-through the cutest thing ever doesn't even have anything to like cover up my boobs why does eBay do the eBay listing for us and it's kind of looks ways to get the same like this life is a lot more revealing it to my bra being underneath the dress I'm kind of mad because I don't really make it seem like you need a wet anything underneath this I would probably won't let anything honestly swear you know when you put in the wash and then what happened to all my adamantly the whole thing are you wear bikini top under it and maybe can you tell me something sleep laugh but apparently I don't are in white bikinis because like who wants to risk a see through bikini iPhone are they going to be safe how to tell if they apparently it's easier on the voters as well the dress itself could have been pretty if it was like good quality but like the quality ain't really bad can you can hardly tell where this dress isn't the dress in the fighter because she's kind of like walking the dress up which is actually possible with this dress like if I was to do that this is what it look like older the crochet slash like lace is completely different I feel like this is pretty but like if you want some coverage then if not really going to be there I definitely think it looks If part of the Dorothy still address like it's still technically in a dress form so I'm going to read the dress at two and a half out of town I would definitely not but if I was going to prom I would try my very hardest to learn take the real version of this dress and actually think that I could wear that is a prom dress play took all of eternity to come it seriously took so long if which is why they senior is are they going on now because are this dress is stuck in the bag holy crap this is the longest dress in the whole world you are pretty I think it's called like love hot top area I'm just so good an explanation it's really pretty it's like a baby pink older like the dresses I think I've ever seen in my entire life which other things this is going to be I am actually obsessed with his death it starts again I actually feel like this is like my favorite dress that I've tried on in the series of it turn is the quality of the dress is like super bomb to me like I'm not sure if I'm going to show you guys this I'm just like pulling up my dress like three lines I think there's only one yes and it is that there is nothing spikes on this dress that I actually think could be cutting my stomach right now but like the dress is cute so it's worth it I think the Amazon it had a bad dress yet I'm just getting really quickly to look at the further you can take it looks the same 2 seconds is my password I love Amazon I actually preferred is callable also like things Amazon it's just actually looks like the fighter I'm so pissed and if I had to rate the quality on probably right at 9 because it's like stabbing me a lot right now and then lastly whatever again I would definitely wear it again I'm actually sad because I don't have a good witness so I'm like someone invite me to prom little is from eBay and I honestly feel like it's going to be really good quality because kind of heavy which too many I don't know if that's a good way to judge it but I feel like heavy means quality wow this is glamorous oh my goodness you look for the inside of this just like these two Superman what camera way hold up I fainted actually looks really pretty could be that really what I expected them to be like I think this is actually going to look through this Eva cute the only thing at that I'm not hundred percent what is the super super super round food inside just turn this stupid dress up is actually stuff cuddle and is it is like literally stuck at this point it's really pretty because it's like a flowy and princessy no one I definitely do nothing for this dress looks anything like the fighter even Scott doesn't see Misfit it or anything I mean the kind of seeing similar but when you really think about it honestly I do not know how to write the quality is the quality of the sky what is so good I'm going to rate the quality like A5 and there is no way that I would buy the problem leaving alone I have another drive this one is from as another mary-sarah I have a pair of shoes like dramatic and it instantly bios3 my life it's going back way to think of super pretty casual I feel like an early show high climber if you want to go you're but I feel like this one is more casual they are leaving that probably going to go wrong with this dress is it is not going to fit me I hate dresses that you cannot wear bra you holy heck this is so tight I think I need super pretty I'm not sure if it's like fancy not to be a pro wrestler it's definitely more casual Avicii dress me like a date I think they mean green is really pretty easy only thing which is actually my own fault but I feel like I could emiliana dit in a size up because I could barely get the zip up cuz it's very tired other than that I feel like because it is super cute though I feel like it's a long dress or short dress songs kind of like the full inventory because it's like super cute Pandora support I like food support because like this dress is not providing it and then I probably wouldn't buy the dress to prom but I would wear it again which was your favorite dress I feel like it's no surprise but mine is the Amazon pink one is your favorite white on the comments directed to let me know what your favorite season is is it so lucky winter Jews hate weather and if you'd like this video people that for me and don't forget to subscribe if you haven't already taken few years every single week and if

I am an inbound PA and I been at him 7 for a little over I started at the tear while I was on the pack line I was a packer for a while from there I moved into rebane which was it a positive for me and from there problem solved from problems all I wanted to Ally Problem Solver I applied for a seasonal position and pack and I got it I did that for about a year then I also interviewed right before that for a permit to your three roll and got it in Bal PA so what that entails is basically performing the duties in the task of an area manager when the present so even that being here I got to kind of get out there make sure everybody's were there supposed to be make sure all the work is Flowing consistently so that we can inevitably get it to hell play Guitar customer on. So one of those experiences when I was a seasonal PA and outbound they had me do a stand up in front of a lot of people and I've struggled in my time Sam are large groups and communicating so pushing me into that really help me in that communication level I came here with great expectations and I had something to those very well it's been a fun and exciting Journey for me I'm shooting for the moon coming up I'm going to move my way up into an area manager and then chew the GM absolutely

how do you do it's Tracy from entrepreneur girl today we are going to be talking about scanning apps and more specifically we're going to be talking about the free Emma Seller Central skating up that you can download onto your smartphone I've had so many people ask me to put out this video because we've talked about standing up what's the we haven't specifically talked about the free one that Amazon puts out so where are we covering that today and I think it's just the what time to do so because we've been talking about Retail Arbitrage and online Arbitrage and liquidation and purchasing all of these products will escaping at please really big part in that because we're in the store or app is like our Lifeline to making good purchasing decisions and so it's very riddle that we have that and that we know how to use it and that we know how to you know decipher the information that were getting from it so that is what we're going to be talking about the I hope it answers all the questions that you wanted it to so here we go okay so the first thing you want to do is grab your smartphone and go to the App Store and make sure that you download the free Amazon seller app which is different from the regular Amazon app and you can see that black and it's right there on my phone now you're only allowed for spots on the bottom and you can see two of my parking spot is eBay and Amazon cuz I use those so much I just want them front and center like you see right there so now we're going to get into the actual scanning of a product play pushing into our Amazon seller app anyways I don't really have any problems with that so you can come and down below your experiences but I'm pretty kind of just act like I'm sing I guess if I were to be off I would say his price checking because that is a true statement I'm checking the price on Amazon but I just you know can I quickly and nonchalantly scan right in front of me they want to make sure that you're scanning the barcode on the bottom of the package sometimes they try slick and they put their store barcode over the barcode so that you can't scan it so a lot of times I will actually pill off the store bar code so that I can scan it with my app you have to scan every single item before you buy it and the reason for that is because you don't want to underestimate Amazon fees you don't want to not make a good purchasing decision and so if I can't scan it say I'm having trouble with the Internet or having trouble with my phone or I ran out of battery life on my phone and I will actually postponed my trip because when you buy a product is when you make your money or lose your money and so I'm you're very careful to have my apps on my phone and also to have my phone charged and also to have a secondary quick charge for my song with me what I remember so that I always have my scanning apps available how to you know what to click and how to evaluate it okay so here on my phone now here at the top you can either manually enter in the name or the barcode of the product or you can click on to your camera to scan a product which of course is the fastest way and the way that I always try so here you can see kid trying to take a picture I'm going to take one of our products and I'm going to scan this is what comes up this cream what you really want to do is scroll and make sure that the product you're looking at for Price matches next product that's in front of you and an example of this would be if you look at the second one it is a pack of 12 and unless you have a pack of 12 that's not testing you're looking for if you look at the third one then you can see that it is a hundred count and the boxes that were looking at is actually 40 filters so when I scroll and look at what we have I can then make sure that I have the right category like this is in grocery that I have the count that I have the right color that I'm actually looking at the exact product that I want so the first one is what we want because it's in kitchen and most everyone can a cell and kitchen which is kind of an added secondary tip because if you're not on gated in grocery you can make they sell the same product but in a different category and this is the perfect example of it because their coffee filters and it is sold both in grocery in Kittanning going to be doing the first one in kitchen that's a 40-count of the number twos and their white this is exactly our product so we're going to click on it okay so the next screen that comes up is this one here and as you can see right here go to the low price minus the fees and then your gross proceeds and then on the second line it tells you if Amazon is selling it which none sir not if FBA sellers are on it which there are there are three and the FBA price is for $8.49 and then new where is there's other competition there's for others and they are from $8.49 so you can also see if mountable to sell this this app will protect you from buying something hopefully that you are not able to remind from what I said it may not necessarily be the product but it might be the category that you're trying to sell it in so read anything that you see here oh well also if you see any exclamation point anywhere on the screen so the very first thing that I look at on this product when I bought it at the liquidation store was of course the rank the rank is up here in the corner is 83374 so that's good rank anything in that category under about 120,000 I would consider I really like to see as a general rule everything under 100000 if I see around 50,000 then I know it's a fast seller so I'm happy with this ad 3000 range then the stain I look at is to make sure that yes you know course that's my product and I want to look at the competition in this is this green for the competition so I can see that I'm not selling against Amazon I can see that there are three prime numbers and that there's only 4 total competition so I also really like this screen because yay I'm going to be you know one of four Prime sellers selling this and you know there's just not a lot of competition on it so that's great I also while I'm find mindful of the lowest price I'm only concerned with prime because I'm Prime so I'm not going to be concerned with that $3.50 + $4 + 99 pet shipping I'm only concerned with $8.49 from One Prime $8.49 from another Prime and then $9 and ninety since from the last Prime seller so I know that my price needs to be between $8.49 and $9.99 I'm also chained up the condition and I see that we're looking at new and mine is new so we are good to go with that then I said I want to do is calculate the fees when to click on desktop one here and you can see that the first tab is for seller fulfilled and then it's the one that you see and T-Rex the next tab is Amazon so so so many times so please listen because I know you there are making this mistake every once in awhile to make sure you click on that Amazon for sealed button right here because the fees are completely different I can see that the fees with that bar $4.26 I need to n the shipping to Amazon which I calculate at about $0.25 or $0.50 depending on the size of the product this one is too small and light so I'm going to put $0.25 in that one then on the cost of purchase this one cost me a dollar and $0.19 from the liquid store so I'm going to go ahead and enter that one too so now that I've entered in everything the way that I want it to be I can see that my net profit is going to be 3 dollars in $0.21 per box for this product so I think they had 10 left I bought all 10 and I will send them in the only thing that's not on the Amazon seller app that you do need to be mindful of is if your pan anything to have it shipped show you which I wasn't because I was physically at the liquidation store but had I bought these online I would need to pay attention to did I have to spend any money to get it to me the second thing is sales tax if you paid sales tax that is not included on this yet but it doesn't prompt you it doesn't remind you to think those two things so you need to be mindful of it yourself for this liquidation store I use my sales tax certificate so I didn't have any of that so my true net profit play $3.21 now as you might notice this does not meet my I like to see over $10 breaking my own rule I want you to see that because I went to the liquidation store and I found a lot of good things I was there for probably maybe 30 minutes and I literally filled the back of my Jeep and so in situations like that if I can buy in bulk if I play you know 10 items real quick then $3.21 net profit isn't so bad as it's the same 30 minute trip can I might have 200 items see what I'm saying when I take this to the store with me and I'm scanning a product this is the screen that comes up in this is the same exact screen that you're going to get when you scan the same exact product selling is a scanning war that is the whole game when you're out there guys scan scan scan scan scan scan everything even things that you don't think are worth scanning scan anyway because you will be so shocked all the time it does how long you been doing this he was still continuously be amazed and what cells and what sells really well so I saw these coffee filters I don't know five number soul coffee filters before I had no clue right and if your new out there or even you know an old reseller like myself you don't know you don't have one hundred percent and information about 100% of the products so you're going to have to scan to see so when I scan this I had no idea this product is it a good product is it a bad product is it going to sell fast is it going to sell slow I must have scanned you know hundreds of items in the store but your skin very rapidly and you move on and you're just scanning scanning scanning scanning move on but look at this product in the store I thought well I like the rain you know I'm really heavily focused on ranked right now because I'm trying to move my my product quickly you see my YouTube videos I'm trying to change the level of my products how to make a better so I want products that move quickly so that is really great especially coupled with the fact that we have very little competition and they're a little FBA competition and we're not selling against Amazon that means that I bought 10 I'm not going to make a ton of money they're going to sell really quick for me this says scan so that is the button you're going to hit when you're already on an item I want to scan another item and you see the little camera come up so now I'm going to spend next product manually enter the name into the search box you should always do this if you can't find it by scanning it because lot of times it doesn't come up when you scan but for some strange reason comes up when you do a manual search analyze this one now you can see that the rank in the upper in corner is 49836 what that is a terrific rein that's under my 50000 fly off the shelf mark when it's in a really popular category so that means that these sell really rapidly and I can see that yep I'm going to be the only be a seller for this product so I love it I love selling Rank and zero FBA petition Casey's then $13.99 to sell that's my selling price my face with FBA shipping is very lightweight so it's only $0.25 cost to purchase was $2.79 so my net profit per box will be $6 a $0.86 again I bought every box that was on the Shelf there were a few boxes on the shelf that were important dishion I just left them there if you don't know this this is another site tips Amazon is like super super picky about their boxes if your box if your listing your product as new in your box doesn't look brand-new they will send it back to you the things I really like about it is of course it's free so that always nice but secondly you get a lot of information for being a free app I hope that was useful to you I hope it was answering what you wanted to answer if not pop down in the comments below any other questions that you have I'm sure that someone from our YouTube family cancer on my behalf or I'll answer you or we'll put it on another video so thanks guys keep leaving those comments because I really do read them as you save from my making this video because you asked for it and I think it was just the perfect time so thank you thanks for suggesting it keep those comments coming thumbs up if it was useful to you and I'll see you next video keep rocking it by guys

Ellis kickstarter's what if I told you that there was a delicious Savory tree that you've never had before or maybe never even heard of what if I told you that it was probably already in your refrigerator it's the egg well okay so I exaggerated a little we've all enjoyed eggs at some point in our lives but have you ever tasted or ever even seen what's known as a golden egg a golden egg is an egg that was scrambled inside of it shell and its unique preparation that has been relatively on a Chiva bull until now introducing the Golden Goose we carefully designed and engineered a new kitchen tool that allows you to create golden eggs yourself it's the goose that lays golden eggs reduce features are Konami candles abrasion resistant nylon cordage tough scrambling chamber security locking ring and a soft egg designed to fit a variety of egg sizes and shapes inspired by the motion of Victorian era children's toy the goose is a low-tech kitchen appliance designed to take a manage order known as centrifugal forces it's been carefully designed for performance and can thoroughly mix an egg while protecting it from breakage the way it works is the whole two eggs safely in his cradle spinning motion evenly mixes the egg white with the joke over the past year we've carefully designed and developed a goose following a thoughtful design process we started with loads of ideas and sketches different geometric prototypes 3D prints and rubber molds building and testing rough CAD models and performance testing a variety of materials we tested our prototypes variety of situations as well I took the best designed to finalize it with sophisticated computer cab models Weaver find every important aspect and we compared to Goose for manufacturing our next step is the purchase the actual production Tooling in materials we secured competitive quotes from several manufacturers both domestically and in Asia with crossed our eyes and Artie's finalize the design and Engineering details and we've had fun inventing new and tasty dishes and how we believe that we've created an Innovative and novel kitchen muscle calf easy-to-use fun and effective oh and do we mention that it's easy to assemble that it's food safe it's made with recyclable materials and it's easily disassemble so it doesn't end up in the landfill I want say it a whole box of Girl Scout samoas are the really good dad eat as much candy as I can once I was watching a movie and I realize I ate a whole pint of ice cream I love hot Cheeto bacon I love bacon I can't stop eating hot Cheetos help me I'm excited to introduce you to the kitchen safe if fun and easy way to control temptation the kitchen safe to the time I can tear that put you in control let me show you how it works first place an item in the container next rotate the dog set the timer and finally press the dial to activate the lawn once a container is locked if you cannot be open until the timer reaches zero it's that easy I came up with the idea of the kitchen safe will completing my Graduate Studies I was looking for something fun and easy to use and tell me if my food cravings Lil Wayne live a healthier lifestyle I will still being able to enjoy the occasional snack to design a product that lives up to the highest standards I work with Ryan saying engineer and classmate I met was studying at MIT the kitchen safe is a time-lock container to puts you in charge you put an item in the container and set the timer what's the timer set in the button is pressed the container locks and cannot be open until the timer reaches zero it is a simple concept that produces powerful results the goal one is play the kitchen safe it's create a high-quality product that works well looks good and is fun to use the product has a large clear display a smooth dial study law at a clean look the compares to the highest quality containers available in stores 

you're so my life is like right now I'm cooking or lying in bed or playing video games and I suddenly remember oh I need more battery Spore I need to pick up my laundry in exactly 24 minutes maybe just want to hear some Dave Matthews Band like right now in every one of those cases I do the same thing I say Alexa and the Randall exit to do something set a timer add batteries to my shopping list play Ants Marching and crude oil in this thing is black cylinder about the size of a can of tennis balls that sitting on self response it's a Bluetooth speaker and it's a personal assistant let's get that first one out of the way now it's a terrible Bluetooth speaker it's really awkward connection system and just bad tamme shallow sound since it has to be plugged in all the time you really can't take it anywhere it's just never going to replace a real wireless speaker being able to search for music is nice but not when it's just Prime music I heart radio in TuneIn but of course calling the echo Bluetooth speaker is like calling kit from Knight Rider car point is everything else the echo can do everything Alexa can do you can change your name by the way if you have someone named Alexa or Alexis in your house but you can only change it to Amazon so if your son and daughter Amazon and Alexis you're basically just screwed I can add things to a really basic to do list in the companion app shopping list but no she can't just randomly order things for you that show up in business days so that would be awesome Alexa can also take basic commands and answer basic questions I think half the time I used it to check the weather or find out how many tablespoons are in a cup 16 tablespoons but from telling jokes to looking things up to telling you the time Alexa is an incredible Fountain of useful information his left ear his right here and his final frontier and most of the time it works and when it does it feels like magic Alexa can also tell you when the Civil War ended or who won the next turn last night although I should say she usually will tell you these things because sometimes she just sometimes Alexa doesn't hear me right even in super quiet rooms and sometimes she hears me but refuses to answer the question instead of making me open up the companion app and go through my search history to find it Dad is fine and it works on Android and iOS in addition to Amazon's devices but it's also one hundred percent not the point of this device to make it ever so slightly easier for you to search the internet with a nap in a quiet room but as soon as you say some music some weird Prime music playlist comes on it's just over she can't hear you anymore she won't tell you she doesn't hear you either the blue at the top comes on as if she's doing something and then it just goes for all the reasons that the echo feels so simple when it works it's maddeningly unhelpful when it doesn't yeah sure you can press the button on the top to make sure the echo is listening but by the time I've walk all the way over there to do it it would be easier to just pick up my phone there's also a remote but taking that out of my pocket is as much work as taking my phone out of my pocket I mostly think Amazon was smart thank you plug in the Echo to use it because it means you don't need to worry about it being charged and turned on all the time but the idea that you can just leave the echo where it is and use it anywhere it's just not true you have to buy basically one for every two or three rooms which is just crazy I found it most useful in the kitchen where I'm always doing other things with my hands anyway so I left my echo there the thing about the Echo and any voice control device right now is that it works a lot and when it works it's awesome but by the time I've spent two minutes yelling Alexa volume 3 while she blasts whatever Huey Lewis in the the song she found on Amazon Prime I just give up if you were a great Bluetooth speaker I'd say by this thing right now it's going to get better fast as it gets more apps more content and more smarts and it almost worth it just to have a voice controlled way to add things to my shopping list while I play video games but for $199 craziest most unreliable personal assistant ever she's the best until she's the worst until she just completely ignores you while she plays Katy Perry at her desk I want the echo to be great I want one of my house I think it'll get there but it probably won't be this version

annual price of an Amazon Prime membership recently Rose from $79 to $99 so is it still worth it turns on how much you buy watch and read with an Amazon Prime membership you get free 2-day shipping from Amazon.com access to the Amazon Prime streaming Library access to the Kindle lending library what are these perks really worth in short the Prime Membership will pay for itself in shipping if you order a lot from Amazon including low price and you like getting your stuff fast the cost of 2 day shipping for one item ranges from 8 to $15 so you really need to order at least 10 items that you want delivered into what's make the Prime Membership worth it to have a bunch of small orders that you don't need right away standard shipping ranges from $48 for one item but you only pay what if you're spending less than $35 so you need about 20 items under $35 a standard shipping to make your membership feedback Amazon Prime streaming video service is most comparable to Netflix which is 799 per month so if you use the service the value is about $96 what's a covering your annual membership cost but keep in mind you can't watch House of Cards on Amazon streaming if you have a Kindle you can borrow up to one book what's from the 500,000 titles in the lending library if his title could be purchased for Kindle for about $5 value of this perk is $60 for the year does Amazon Prime still a good deal if you order at least 10 times from Amazon Prime order at least one item two day shipping or some combination of all three

after two decades in business amazon.com is the world's largest internet retailer with the stock value that has increased tenfold since 2008 that success is driven by Force motivated by David driven managers who stick to principles laid down by company founder Jeff Bezos that's part of the takeaway from today's New York Times story in how to Amazon Wrestling Big Ideas in a bruising workplace based on more than 100 interviews the story to fix a corporate culture where employees are pushed to the Limit David stripes is one of the authors who joins me now from San Francisco so what is the culture that you found a very hard-working we're a culture where people feel they want to push themselves as far as they can and they do so far none of that what you just said sounds bad thing for a company now it's a great thing for a company of Taipei performers and they're always performing add the limits of what they can do you can do amazing things which Amazon indeed has what did you find unique about what's happening inside Amazon's work unique thing was just how well they maintain that culture of endurance and excellence startups to that sort of thing they work all the time and people are completely devoted to the company and the rest of their life Falls away mixing with Amazon is they had preserve to a large extent that startup culture to a company that implying 10 tens of thousands of people and that's a remarkable thing to do and I don't know if many other companies if any that have managed to show me the anecdotes you write about are almost in direct opposition to the other stories about tech life that we hear the Netflix has a year-long turn it in your paternity leave policy that they want Institute in Google has no fabulous free food everywhere that's not what you get when you walk into Amazon's offices that's true Amazon is much more severe it in as a lot of Technology but in some ways it's self-image is not of a tech company self-image is as a retailer and in the retail business margins are very thin and benefits are comparatively lass and you describe the situation at the what is it the end of every year where they essentially cut back their employees depends performers a technique which was relatively widespread in Corporate America maybe 10 years ago and some companies other companies still use it now called other the crudest name for it which companies do not use his Rank and yank you decide where everyone fits those are the bottom those the rank the lowest you either encouraged to leave or you could just release them what did Amazon say to this as you are report Amazon has always prided itself on being a very tough place to work they've said from the very beginning is Jeff Bezos said very early on to new employees it's not easy to work here without it being without those high standards you probably never would have heard of Amazon it would not is this now the question is for employees who are diverted by crises what happens to them David strive to one of the co-authors of the piece from The New York Times thanks so much thank you
