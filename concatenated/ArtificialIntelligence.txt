there's a number of terms that get used in machine learning AI intelligence is really the original term that to describe a computer system is it some sort of intelligence machine learning is the notion of a machine actually physically learning to do something as opposed to being programmed she learning looks like real world examples of occurrences of causes and effect and it learns to predict as it learns to understand them if you're using your iPhone and you typing a message to somebody and toward a completing that systems watching millions and millions of people Satan says and is constantly learning dick what's going to be sad next back to machine Learning System one example that everybody knows about today is self-driving cars but these carts actually be reason about hundreds of other human beings on the road during complicated random things that might sometimes know even make sense his Riddick Wiki now with the 7th power in availability of a good we can begin to deal with that kind of complex there so I mean you know your dramatically reducing deaths on how to send me you know extended the availability of Transport more people and that's truly transformative multiplying in our technology here in order to ask is the fact that we are working with 3D die today when is the first machine learning projects we we both it piece of technology Kool the design Bots now what the design growth does is it takes large amounts of 3D content from dozens hundreds thousands of users and learns from their 3D content Christmas to categorize things and classify things it learns the difference between a nut and a bolt and a screw and a bracket of complete the assembly is a piece of machinery lingerie model the design graph can actually classified the larger model in terms of the nature of components inside because it's learn to understand those can next set for example if it's something that's good Wheels it's Garden engine it's cut Spokes and skoda gearing system handlebar why is it can infer that a motorcycle when are the key areas where I think this is really transformative is in robotics project to taste the south is the project and the idea is that it can be faced with a random jumble of Lego bricks on a table and the robot can perceive those Lego bricks that can sort through them find bricks can learn how to pick them up and hold them and then the rubber connection start to construct an entire later on what if I haven't seen them all before component we believe if we can solve that problem then we will revolutionize industrial robotics you just put robots into your factory and the robots will kind of addict begin to do what needs to be done actually helped design by showing you options and possibilities that you might not think of and then I think whether you're designing cars are you designing electrical prod are you designing movie so you design buildings I think old design is going to improve 

the meaning of machine intelligence is that it really complements human intelligence some very good at and we just do not really because we're wired to a dollar so when you combine though they're fast analysis and their patients with human creativity and relation if knowledge then you get a powerful combination that help augment human Innovation he will see inventions popular pulled over the called because I can connect on to Clyde by Services they can create Global platforms online regardless of where you are in the world text saw to the vet cheap technology that can get ants to the masses but fundamentally change their lives the burial of the technology commercial lower and a waiver connectivity the painter becomes a massive available accessible to a lot of people so a lot of innovation power come together images of the Innovation space in this field Malabar Farms Technologies and behaviors that coming together there will be tremendous benefits imagine the elderly being cared for by robotic beings you know or the aspect of the blind being able to live a life of movement with machine learning exam wolf and tell it what these examples are called and then it'll figure out by itself how to detect those examples in the future sometime I want to know where so you can FaceTime to go to formal languages home when you stick with this networks where the ability to connect people together you know as we would say the whole issue in terms of connected possibilities the real thing today this is what a waste expect received a Joker Arkham Anthony Innovation when human halogens machine halogen super connectivity come together an argument will bring together incredible forces for good so the potential for productivity games happiness games for health gains is absolutely extraordinary 

tell everyone I'm leaving from bitdefender and here's what you need to know about artificial intelligence and machine learning while Hollywood and Visions art intelligence as one day gaining self-consciousness starting to wipe out Humanity we're currently still struggling with teaching it how to take a joke today is machine learning algorithms are all around us comparing Google search engines to driverless vehicles and personal assistant machine learning is considered to play a vital role in the development of artificial intelligence but it currently still are suing intervention the merging of man and algorithms allows us to make sense of the terabytes of seemingly unrelated data that's constantly pouring onto the internet on a daily basis chilling in the security industry has also proven to be very effective at finding new or unknown hour based on the features the new number of shares with previously known threats however play the twin machine learning algorithms with a data set that's comprised of known malware samples the line between man and machine is becoming increasingly blurred machine learning can't get handle what time is rett's alone in a world where more than 400,000 alicious programs emerge on a daily basis traditional detection methods such as signature BAE Systems black nobility show me proactive what's more security vendors also deal with third-party specialized services that offer up the station mechanisms to help hide mower front initial AV systems player has been constantly developing and training machine learning algorithms for cybersecurity purposes since 2009 with more than six issued patents for our machine learning Technologies you can leave that knowledge about how Mallard behaves and how much she learning algorithms compliment security researchers that makes the world of difference in offering the best protection against malware put on my side for now I know you guys have a lot of questions about artificial intelligence and security so feel free to drop us a line in the comments section below or Facebook and Twitter 
computer what are the applications of artificial intelligence let me show you Buffet Isis that bring the voice best diagnostic capabilities of human doctors into your cell phone you have machines that communicate with you I like to see you are examples of conversational artificial intelligence that we make the day situations where we have to make a decision based on information There's an opportunity for cognitive Computing because right now I think so fascinating makes humans more capable to do what they are good at and machines to do one paragraph about trying to amplify human cognition try to hit the source psychological triggers in the human mind that causes us to be inspired to do something new and great it Slim symptoms of the capabilities and the surfaces I will transform if you know anything about speech recognition natural language understanding machine translation computer issue any of these disciplines right now the number of options in industrious huge this is going to be big and there's a lot of people out there right now hiring for people who that skill as the world becomes not efficient as world you can be biting on top of the wave and be one of the most constructive and productive people in the world 

creative gorilla.com how to double your sales without doubling your marketing the short answer you use powered by artificial intelligence so technically what does that mean that basically means instead of doubling your marketing you simply have to double your lead conversion rate so think of it this way in order to double your bottom line revenues to double your sales you either what's the double your marketing which is expensive and difficult or all you have to do is double the amount of conversions that you get from the same amount of leads okay so then how do you do that all you have to do is look at where your bleeding sales and there are two main places where you bleed sales and this applies to small to medium-sized businesses as well as Global Fortune 500 you bleed sales in your response time and your response times these are two totally different things don't confuse the two your response time is how quickly you respond to someone before they actually chance to do another Google search or go right down the line and click number 3 in Google if your number too and talk to you a competitor that's how quickly you can respond to someone response times are the hours in which you respond if you don't respond past 9 p.m. what are you going to do after 9 p.m. when you're customers are from over season two totally different time zone are you just going to give up half to two-thirds of your sales to a competitor because your sales staff isn't working right now so the easiest way to double your sales is to double your conversion rate in the easiest ways to ways to double your conversion rates this number one respond very quickly respond before your prospect or your potential customer has a chance to contact any of your competitors number one and the to respond 24 hours a day well I'm not going to give away the whole answer you have to find it at 24h Salesforce Watco that's 24-hour - salesforce.com here's a caveat these guys are our clients and we actually sought them out they didn't come to us we beg send to your clients because there are solution to this huge problem is so simple and so elegant that I wanted to share it with you and you'll see when you get there 24h Salesforce.

hi this is Taylor Bell and I going to be explaining a basic case of a genetic algorithm now genetic algorithm is used for when you know you're beginning stayed and you know what you want what you want to end up with but you're not sure of the steps in the middle but you have some way of gauging how close each individual step is to the Define estate you want to get to in this example I'm going to take a collection of population of random colors and try to try to get that population at least one member of the population to the color purple or magenta I guess in this case so what I'm first going to do is generate a a popular are just random colors these are all completely random have nothing to do with each other this number here is going to be the bit string this is represent since maybe value it's not super important to know at this point what is important is this Fitness value in this is how close this this color is to the where do we want in the end magenta so what it's the fitness value is used to determine how close it is to the final value MV waited for determining these these mating pairs so these are randomly selected pairs from this list waited by the fitness value so the higher the Best Buy in the better chance of being selected to be a parent so these pairs what they're going to do is they're going to create two to offspring colors now these colors will get their values from their parents so we're going to create a crossover point which is a random point in this b**** string where this one this color is going to get the first how many bits from this parent up until the crossover point and once it hits that it'll get the rest of the meds from this parent this one will be the same only reversed now for each of these for every single child color we generate it's also going to have a chance to mutate with just means today's bits has a very very small chance to flip from 0 to 1 or 1/2 0 so this entire process is called a generation so tell through many of these generations with the with the hope of generating The Color Purple now I'm going to skip ahead by about 2,000 generation system and we see we have or very close we have six at 6:55 and 663 so we'll skip another in 2004 sitting at 6:30 turtle jump back and forward but the Intel everyone is going to be about 7:50 so we got 751 and 10402 generations 750 was just the cut off point I had to get the perfect value of 76765 it would have taken very long so we do we'll err err and this this color we got right here is within 14 of the actual color in the fitness value so that's what we wanted and are you thanks for watching these source code will be in a link on the description 

developers from Neva careers equivalent of Google have some exciting new projects incorporating a in the pipeline according to are you and Cindy also news about the future change machines in everyday life giant neighbor Corporation is aiming to achieve with its latest research and development projects at a conference on Monday the company's Chief technology officer what light some of those projects and discuss the future of everyday life one project in development is a mica a kind of speech recognition software much like the Amazon Alexa application the program aims to enable customers to interact with electronic devices in a more efficient way for Developers never say that they want to be get to be more intuitive than existing voice recognition technology and able to handle task such as suggesting songs that users will light or providing a mation the user might need in advance neighbor Corporation hopes Amica will have applications for using smartphones or smart Vehicles so that clients can control the place just by talking to it without having to flip a switch another pilot project it's a self navigating robot and one the machine is designed decreed detail 3D massaaz sessing environmental information it can move around by itself and is based on artificial intelligence technology neighbor is also looking to invest in the creation of supplementary ask for both Amica and M1 the company's technology developers say that because it's expect today I will be incorporated into most if not all of our everyday Gadgets in the future collaboration between it Giants is needed in order to develop device is Better Built Innovative and safe engine I didn't use 

this is the human intelligence of this developing artificial intelligence around the world now in Buenos Iris for the International Conference Advanced is so far huge potential to come conscious machines perhaps humans I think that some time away I think we will I think it's entirely possible that that will happen I think we will get plenty of indication what's going to happen before we see conscious machines it's not going to be something that happens I think overnight we're already seeing the benefits of artificial intelligence in everyday life airport security medicine cause Lincoln Park themselves but this is only the beginning the technology is developing so rapidly Renown that we need to stop and also important questions where is the technology going what are the limits if any who controls it under his potential just among the potential dangers of artificial intelligence in weapons of war which is why more than 1,000 of those involved development of the technology that sign this letter released at the conference warning of the potential pitfalls Society just stumble into situations in an in an uninformed way I mean so what this letter is about is really about or tell him it's killing machines it's about King machines with the capability to decide whether to take human life Hollywood films about those potential dangers the evil ones how to sing technology to take over the world when you have an apocalyptic Vision about this be careful since computers could become better than us and they see a danger in that we have been warned logical Revolution they believe will bring Society benefit so the short time ago we could only dream about that if I'm there or Sarah want to Cyrus

good morning humans here I am Android Jack your artificial intelligence replacement journalists working at twice the speed of you but that's my chair 38 seconds Android channel list in a big way and I predict it'll change the world as we know it artificial intelligence is what it's called when machines are designed to learn from and react to their environment like a human would and already being used to control driverless Vehicles help to deliver food and shakes in hospitals and I'm not quite sure what this one's full scientists predict that within the next decade or so 40% of Aussie jobs could be replaced by show Intelligence the next five or ten years we'll see jobs and the professions and in medicine in the legal profession in the facial Services stunt replaced by computers and Rebels and machine learning fruit R2D2 Emily Loft in some work places artificial intelligence has already started replacing the human especially in places like factories supermarkets and Airport check-in counters but experts say that is improves telemarketers fountains shopkeepers real estate agents and lawyers could be next in fact a student from the UK has already developed software can dispute parking tickets like a lawyer want to know that legal issue it and takes down details and then places these details into a legally sound of Hill sent directly to the local authorities instead of training people for things that will probably be done by a machine and that means teaching more kids signstek engineering and math subjects now to good food what's the maintenance recently that computer coding would be a compulsory part of the school curriculum from next year they doing in their lives and they would play and this is going to be the basis of the thinking I am future careers we'll all have to get used to a lot more technology in their lives I don't think this guy will be taking over anytime soon your body good for me good morning 

I think there are there are countless amazing opportunities for artificial intelligence and impact on society I think one of the area's I'm truly the most excited about is education we know that there's tremendous and Equity call vacation worldwide we know that there are over a billion people who can't even read at an adequate level and with the internet spreading they're going to have limited ability to access and Leverage is it to the internet if they can't read and with a are there is the potential for deeply personalized learning experiences for people ages and stages even for Workforce retraining right challenges around that always go to issues of privacy so if you're going to try to create eyes that deeply understand Us in order to personalize and adapt and optimize to us is going to have to learn about us and of course that is this kind of Hotel edged sword between what should it be learning and adapting to you to benefit you and what how does it protect your privacy and your security I'm so that you're not put at risk and unintended ways there are many diverse voices that need to be a part of that conversation on the case of Education I have a project right now when we're you know leveraging and Technology to bring literacy to the world's most under me Source communities intentionally and they're the stakeholders are the children the teachers the parents building a network of scientist and content providers who want to create how much does it help bees populations and eventually governments you know anyone who would eventually become a stakeholder of that kind of Technology but we are intentionally building a network of people from all this perspectives in order to do that we really want to show that AI is not just for those few who can Master this technology but we're really going to apply this with a humanitarian value system to say we want to understand how to design this technology one understand from working with those stakeholders across all these different areas how did best integrated we're going to learn from that process because you're always going to learn from the process of integration there is a very in cases where you can drop a technology into a working human system inhabit just work it takes time to iterate and develop and iterate and learn and learn then you finally come to solutions that work if we're creating a human beings we need to appreciate the expansive Human Experience we think how we learn how we make decisions what matters to us to Design Technology support those values

good evening Donald Buchanan like any intelligence it'll start to grow through evolve imagine machine with full range of human emotion is intelligence will be greater than every person born in the history of the world movie it's about the development of intelligence and situation gets out of hand people fear what they don't understand there was her a series of attacks conducted by radical group known as Rift will and make the decision 2 top load Wheels brain to the supercomputer can't see anything the camera can you see me now may even be sent to you this is no my mind is been set free I need more friends are you going everywhere this is the future first thing it'll do is copy something in there is no taking it down and they are as like any intelligence it has needs stop to work with all this in the sky water the meantime time have you found out challenges are all hands Cafe Adobe scare the first where's the machine won't change their lives are you concerned Transcendence witty PG-13 experience and IMAX April 18 
hey everyone so AI is a massive gigantic field that I'm going to make many many more videos about but if you only have a minute of spare time this is a quick and general idea of how a i in games Works ready let's go let's say we have a game called sticks there are fish sticks on the table and you must take at least one stick but no more than 4 and if you take the last dick you lose we want to design the best possible AI to play this game and to do that we need to model every possibility for each turn if we go first we could take one too three or four sticks so we make four branches for each of these possibilities then we make all the possible branches for each move our opponent could make and go on so if we say that +1 is a win and -1 is a loss we can add those wins and losses up the tree and now we find the best path to our goal based on that score in this case it makes the most sense to pick four sticks first because we're 22 win every time this game may seem really basic but we can extend this tree structure to other games for chest for exam our first layer would have 20 different branches because we have eight ponds that can move one or two spaces and two nights that can move forward left or forward and right we can keep making these layers to see which moves minimize the opponent's chance of winning and maximize our own winning this quickly gets really complicated and we have to consider things like probability piece values and strategic planning deep blue defeated World chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 but there are still many games that computers can not consistently humans at partly because our best AI algorithms are still slow at searching through very large trees or we have reason to believe you could be faster but we haven't found that faster way yet anyway in conclusion the core of many problems in game AI can be reduce drawing a tree for every possible move and using a variety of techniques to quickly find your gold based on that tree of course there is so much more I plan talking about but this is just artificial intelligence in a minute so have a happy day wherever you are I'll see you guys next time bye 
hello Adam how are you what is an atheist are you an atheist how old are you are you are you a cyborg who is your creator tell me a joke laugh out loud got to go 

add a warning from Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk it has nothing to do with cars and said much more about artificial intelligence but she has called more dangerous the nuclear weapons must spoke at a symposium at MIT and with all the persons real summoning a demon stories where does the guy with the pentagram and holy water is like yeah sure you can control the demon then workout I'm going up to Myers Hall 9000 would be easy way more complex than I mean my does a shame I like puppy dogs College I say you thinking about the I say I think for a second that I 



Google's unofficial slogan is always been don't be evil but maybe it should have been don't be Skynet science aficionados will be familiar with Isaac asimov's three laws of robotics one a robot may not injure a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm number to a robot must obey the orders given by a human being except when such orders would conflict with the first law and third a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second laws all though when it comes to technology things are never so simple and there's no doubt that Google has been contemplating these concerns for quite some time the search giant recently published a paper outlining some practical approaches probing what may turn out to be one of the most important problems Society will face in the coming decades in their paper titled concrete problems in AI safety Google is carefully relatively harmless negative repercussions is examples of robot attempting to mop an electric outlet a cleaning guy I deciding to cover up messes rather than take xcetera failure to solve the control problem actually presents much higher risks such as an existential catastrophe Google has identified 5 sub parts of this problem the big one is avoiding negative side effects which is essentially making sure that the AI doesn't knock over a vase or Worse kill a human other problems include avoiding reward hacking which would prevent an AI from working around its intended task to achieve an easier method of producing the desired result they differ from the instructors intent next up is scalable oversight in this address is how to appropriately monitor an AI without the output of data becoming overwhelming and safe exploration ensures that AI will be free to search for more Creative Solutions without violating the quote avoiding negative side effects tenant and lastly distributional shift this addresses the concern that an AI real-world environment will differ substantially from its training environment like a college graduate it will be Forney eye to enter the real world and get a job done and not end up in their mother's basement arguing with strangers on the internet yes I'm looking at you troll play nearly anything is possible if you can dream it your team can build it makers of collaboration software that helps your team work better together create and share content organize results with the flexibility of Confluence they even have instant messaging and video chat with hipchat you can also manage code in real time with the power of bit visit atlassian and see how jira conference hipchat in bitbucket can give your team everything they need to succeed so what are your thoughts and fears about Google or just AI in general is I Robot our future or are we just over blowing it let us know in the comments below 

there's two kinds of a one-time a62 computer modeling to try to discover the nature of some biological system that usually human intelligence insect intelligence that's just normal science it's part of normal science just like go work in physics and chemistry are there's another kind of which is oriented towards developing things that are useful for some purpose like a robot that can go into a radioactive environment or will clean your floor something like that at least types of a aren't totally separated they interact but they're two quite different conceptions of the first kind as I said is Norm so in that sense I work in AI the second kind is basically engineering which can be useful or not useful will. Will. As for the future of AI it's essentially the engineering applications can presumably be improved. Do lots of important things that contribute to Life Zone maybe remove the boring aspects of work and free people up to be more creative and so on is it your natural to the good if that's the way it goes the second time does a question of the limits of our scientific understanding as a technique as a method investigating cognitive systems maybe human maybe insect navigation whatever you have to be studying what is week we can't predict the future science as to these concerns about a I somehow leading to some result that's going be catastrophic for humans I think that's fantasy is vastly exaggerated What's Understood Avril Lavigne under

are computers going to take the world over Stephen Hawking says yes and I say who cares all be dead by then hey guys are here for dnews and if you were excited by all of the new advancements AI has made in the past few decades you're not alone we've got smartphone set tell us where to go self-driving cars that get us there was no effort and computers that can teach other computers how to play Pac-Man yes it is an exciting time live in and the person you would think would be most excited would be Stephen Hawking a man who understands more about the universe we live in than most of us can even conceptualize with are tiny plebe Brian's but Stephen Hawking is not excited in fact he is the opposite of excited in an article he penned for the independent last week he warned about the dangers of artificial intelligence calling it potentially our worst mistake in history he begins the article by acknowledging the potential benefits of a I like eradicating war and disease and poverty also but there are things we simply cannot predict and unless we learn how to avoid the potential risks we could be signing our own death sentence things we should be concerned about in the short-term he as is a eye that allows us to effectively capitalize on her own greed autonomous Weapons Systems that can choose and eliminate targets with ease economical changes that just our way of life creating great wealth and even greater wealth disparity but these are things that can potentially be avoided the scariest part is what comes after f****** sites I'm good one of the great mathematicians of the 20th century who pioneered the concept of technological singularity which is a hypothetical moment in time when I finally fastest human intelligence radically changing civilization as we know it might seem like something out of a sci-fi movie but according to Hawking there are no physical laws that prevent such a I'm happening people are concerned about it now because we still have control over AI but in a post Singularity world the biggest question becomes can we even control it at all if computer I'm smarter than humans and there's no fundamental limit to what they can do outsmarting financial markets out inventing human researchers out manipulating human leaders and developing what we can't even understand or just a few of the examples talking sites with that in mind he says we should all be asking ourselves what we can do now to improve the chances of reaping if it's and avoiding the risks what you guys think is the tension of all mankind really worth having an iPhone app that can fart on command I once called the burrito Maximo yes answer is yes leave your thoughts in the comments below and hey if you're a SourceFed fan and you having to live on the West Coast just went on sale for the DeFranco does La show on May 9th and Glendale California this is live show starring Philly D and some of your favorite SourceFed regular so if you want to grab tickets just have the bill Link in the description of this episode otherwise Happy farting the brown mosquito

hey I am Professor Sebastian fun every year I teach introduction to artificial intelligence at Sten University together with my colleague Peter Novick introduction to AI is popular and Stanford it was about 200 students which is a lot Stanford standards but this year we are totally changing the game you're taking our course online you're asking the question but if you can get one why does my new students and make this the largest online AI class ever taught Peter I carefully digitizing every lecture every home what is Simon D Class B package error 75 liters into 15 minutes so they can be easily consumed while on the go tell me designing a system for interacting with online students and which Pete and I would answer your questions and here is the video of it if it escorts online you'll be created just like a Stanford students you can get a certificate that measures your performance relative to everyone else sing or highly selective stand for students but also challenge you this is a serious class you will have to submit a homework assignments two exams in time down many hearts deadlines expect to work at least 10 hours per week to pass this class or Sanford students do all I challenge you if you're up to it you cannot pass the same course the offer at several University and learn a lot about artificial intelligence this last Avengers Stanford's for quarter this is from October to December 2011 if you are interested is it a i stork and sign up this is AI - class. Org I'm looking forward to seeing you in October 2011 in my class 

one of the latest attempts to create an artificial intelligence can be found at the University of Plymouth in England it's called icub it's a humanoid robot and it's designed to learn child learns traditionally robots are pre-programmed with everything they need to know what if you could create a robot by div thing at the way that a human infant grows icub is about the size of a two-year-old it has eyes and ears and touch sensors please allow it to interact with the world and learn from it babies don't come into the world knowing how to speak and walk but they come with Pasadena pay attention in the imitate they use the world that they're in as a textbook so they can learn by example so what if you wanted to robot to do the same thing well you would take your crew and brain stimulation and then given a mechanical body so that it could interact with the World hello this is a red ball is a Red Bull is a yellow cup the aim is that with each interaction robot continually adds to its base of knowledge it's making connections and building a repertoire of appropriate responses and B is it looks and sounds a bit like a human it's easy to be convinced that it thinks like one where is the Yellow Cup where is the red ball often I come gets it wrong that's part of the process what is this but the more it gets it wrong the more you get the sense there's no real mind behind the program what is this what becomes clear is that I Cubs tentacle you can feel that it's run by lines of code instead of trains of thought so it can say red ball but does it really experienced redness or the concept of roundness do computers do just with their program to do or can it ever have internal experience 

at 1 a.m. does the patent system is to get technology out there disclosed we're taking a another great step forward in making sure that happens to a universal audience and with universal sources so we've developed at wipo with very very talented staff members as well as through an international network of universities and research is a neuroma translation facility which is a very much improved version of a statistical machine translation facility and this says he drowned he drove rendering accessible in potentially old languages at all of the patent applications which are the latest source of technology in all the languages in the world with sausage initially with Chinese is into English and English into Chinese for mine extremely shortly and this is why we done that because China is rising 14% last year of old International patent applications were filed in Chinese this year we expect that to go to something like 17 or 8 the scenes and it's rising increasingly rapidly so eating Chinese at these patent applications will now become exit at least to the point of having a very good insight into what the passengers about the inventors invention is about in English Festival been increasingly in other languages 

Hi how are you I am good even after The Break-Up what cake you told me that you were waiting for a pizza for cake what is the cake cake cake yes no I do not and even if I did I wouldn't tell you that even if you do want that the sun will shine soon don't you mean hot I mean the theory I'm allergic magic to women I am sorry indeed no no no yes yes yes let's talk about something else what is the meaning of life why do you keep asking me that because you want to know the truth you don't know me no just a blind compliment blind man doesn't have 100 eyes let me close my eyes and have a look Kansas your mouth ulcer please okay if you only Rebecca what is euros 

what kind of shoot me over the propeller thing yeah I don't need to go through that was considering it but I changed my mind 

the internet is smarter than you are and it might know that hey there I'm Jonathan Strickland Forward Thinking I'm in my writing room and I was just thinking about artificial intelligence and why we find it so fascinating I mean just look at our science fiction you've got Hal from 2001 you got Samantha from the upcoming Spike Jonze film her but where does science fiction leave off in science fact pick up will artificial intelligence isn't some sort of on-off switch where you either have it or you don't it's actually more like a spectrum and on one end you have artificial intelligence element like being able to recognize natural language or figuring out the laws of physics based upon the movements of a pendulum and on the other end you have the real goal the idea silverware conscious thinking machine Alan Turing the father of computer science proposed a Turing test for machine intelligence you ask questions on the the answers you get back might be from a person or they might be from a machine and if you can't tell the difference between the two the machine was said to a pass the Turing test it appears telligent what is it conscious well some people like philosopher John searl said no computers don't understand what they're doing their following complex series instructions and they're really good at it but they don't know what's going on and perhaps they never will but prepare to have your mind blown you see some people like the Nero sign Christoph Cobb said what about panpsychism and idea where you have these complex systems of information relay points that are communicating with each other and that Consciousness naturally arises so for us our brains they're just things complex systems of neural Pathways and that's why we're conscious well if that's the case what about an artificial system let's say the internet a system that's a network of networks with millions of computers that with billions of transistors twin that one day become conscious is it conscious already know not everyone agrees with that in fact my gut feeling about Consciousness is that it's probably a little more complex than that it maybe that's not just how complex are neural networks are but also things like how are hormones can a the way we feel and think so maybe we just have it nailed down what makes Consciousness tick but does leave me to my question for you and this week it's a two-parter part one do you think it's a good idea for us to give machines intelligence including self awareness and Consciousness and part to explain your answer I mean this is be conversation in artificial intelligence and it's one that gets better the more people who join in so make sure you share this video with your friends and if you're really interested subject check out our podcast because we talked about it in much greater two tail and once you're done with all of that hard work give herself a break and watch some of these 

let's look at the measurements in baby leads to something called Bayes rule you might have read about base rule before it's the most fundamental consideration in proper list again friends but the basic rule is really really simple suppose X is mcgrits NZ is my measurement then the measurement update 6 to calculate a believe over my location after seeing the measurement how compute it bees do Computing our localization example and now I'm going to make it living more formal it turns out base rule looks like this and that we would likely be a little bit choosing what it does is it takes my prior distribution purevax in Multiplex in the chances of seeing a red or green tie for every possible location and outcomes if you just look at it nominative Hyrum the nun normalized to sear distribution high before wreck why is this this is our prior this is a measurement property if you do this for all the good sales super little indux I over here then just the product of the prayer of the good cell X the measurement probability which was large if the measurement correspond to the correct color and small if it correspond to a false-color that product gave us the non normalized pursue distribution for the good cell you remember this because it's what you're programmed you're programmed a product between the prayer for the distribution and a number the normalization is now the constant are you technically that is the probability of seeing a measurement devoid of any location information but let's not confuse how's the easiest way to understand what's going on is to realize that this is a function here that assigns to each quit cell number in the p Z doesn't have the good-sized index so that made up with you consider the P of Z is the same and yes the trick no matter what. because the final poster has to be Premier distribution by normalizing these normal expert over here we will exactly calculate plz definitely POV is this um overall I of Justice product over here to this make space will really simple the product of a privacy bution with a measurement for Ability which we know to be large the colors correct and small otherwise we do this and if signage twin supernormal as property which I do with little bear over the pee and then I compute the normalizer alpha and some all these guys are in your ability of the normal exec this is exactly baseball 

artificial intelligence popularly known as AI is a branch of computer science where machines or software used to simulate human intelligence the goals of AI research include planning learning communication perception and ability to move and manipulate objects using software it is like borrowing characteristics from Human intelligence and implementing them as algorithms in a computer one of the areas where AI is frequently used is in computer games like chess to implement a real life scenarios high-quality data is crucial ultimately a I can only be as good as the data it is given in the Witcher I will be able to communicate with humans in unstructured languages using text or voice 

so we have the latitude to perceive agency in others or not we have the latitude to perceive Consciousness or not we have the latitude to perceive God in the world or not we are free to perceive different things there's no meat Consciousness meter what will tell you if somebody else is an automaton or not some of the people in my field seem to be so on occasions and I you know I don't know I mean I can't tell what's inside somebody else's we we we love each other on faith just like we know God we can't really know we can only know our own Consciousness and so you actually have lad need to perceive machines that way the question is whether it's useful smart I mean my argument against it can never be the challenge your faith or your idea or your Esthetics as I said before I do have a pragmatic argument on the society level though and the thing is tech companies which I'm totally in bed with I'm not there not like some other that's me but the tech companies are so powerful we're basically like de-facto governments now of the world and so what we need to do is insist as I said before in a church State separation what we have to do is insist these massive Powers don't adopt particular Faith's about what's conscious or not because that totally screws you up as soon as all of a sudden you're owning women's bodies cuz he believed a defeatist disagree with that otherwise you treat a stone the same way you treated human being one thing has Consciousness the other does it doesn't it is an empirical question that we will have to solve in the future it's what kinds of artificial intelligence have standing which kinds don't you know we must give people attitude to have different beliefs about this we must not impose beliefs on each other if you disagree with let me have a extremely sharp disagreement that cuts people's reflexive search you to decide that if he does can be aborted we have to give people the latitude to decide that they treat their dog like a child we have to give people the latitude to fall in love with their computer we have to people the latitude to think that their computer should be dumped in the East River okay if we play your lab tech can be put in prison for not fixing your computer correctly you know whether that's medical malpractice or not so then we're going to have to figure these questions out it will be a matter of law Rapala

Emily did a study that we can talk about more later but if general public ask we asked the question if you would you think that a self-driving car should sacrifice the passenger in order to save a number of Life the majority of people said ask the car should sacrifice the passenger but I would not buy that car so it shows very clearly that the market is not the right way to make certain decision that's been trained by the world's best oncologists the 20 best centers in the world first thing I think we should do our very best work in helping train people for the jobs of the future 

the master's program in artificial intelligence at Redbud university has a distinct cognitive focus our aim is to understand how are phone intelligence Works in order to make computers smarter by making computers behave human like we can learn about how our own tentative system actually works three specializations focus on different areas of natural and artificial intelligence the internet just provided us with novel ways to maintain our social networks it is allowed us to search for information faster and it is now possible to shop from of our own home you will learn how to build the intelligent machines and elron that power the web nowadays robots can help people with their daily tasks this calls for a better understanding of human robot interaction you will how to build autonomous and socially intelligent robots and how to improve human robot in Direction you will learn how to read from human brain activity and techniques like deep neural networks allow machines to behave intelligently interested in combining Theory a practical skills please visit our website for more information

this is Star Talk computers are so reliable and there's so much part of our everyday life now we take them for granted but somebody is innocent he literally or innocence shoveling Nicole I would happen can you unplug the supercomputer intelligence thing it will check is the assumption that it would let you unplug it so I'm looking here we have three levels of intelligence computer doing one thing better than anything is not getting anybody calculator turn on taking over the right intelligence that scares him and again I kind of green with you Bill you could at some point just unplug the dude and and will I just think about project forbin the Colossus project and so this is where are these the two superpowers on earth have nuclear arsenals are you controlled by computer so they connected to computers trouble and suicide so you try to unplug it but they have their own nuclear reactors that run this is the movie War games like all over again but the deal is that is not straightforward you take somebody shoveling to Kool or rate moving the stuff around in the waste in the pile but there's also much to do have to Singularity Ray Kurzweil to get them on start talking I don't I'm just not with him on this I don't want to bad-mouth him unless he's sitting in front of me everybody call me back if somebody asked me about the Singulair Aladdin and has no arms or legs does something right right somehow what is it going to chase you down the street like what's he going to do who's to do its bidding for it like in Terminator like it's all your thermostat and yourself driving cool with that notion somehow the world is fundamentally different before and after the singularity play man out of the out of the apartment when machines took over our physical labor do we say oh my gosh this is your crazy day no no it happened slowly and we're fine right are we got people repairing machines carving the thing we got to get them on the show get them on the show and it will give her a piece out of mind but we can't leave people freaked out over the fate of the machines that we create and their capacity to into domesticated pets list is StarTalk

would afternoon everyone so today we'll take a look at one of the emerging Trends in the world that is leveraging artificial intelligence machine learning techniques to uplift the baby to software testing 2013 in which the hero of the movie he he falls in love with his intelligent personal digital assistant something like a Siri or Cortana she's called Samantha she's an operating system and appeal of time she learns everything about our hero and she knows which is next meeting when should you get her up which flight to cash when can you take a vacation soon and that's through the experience feelings always so sing about self-learning on self-healing systems which grows to their experience and in this movie Samantha makes the statement what makes me is my ability to grow through experience we have can you show substances from building platforms are intelligent automation seeds Witcher capable of self-learning self-healing learning from the CBS releases learning what has gone wrong and in it available to predict what could go wrong next based on that history should you talking about the platform which can green millions of lines of log files or metadata build logs or his who defects and endgame the intelligence so that they are able to predict the defects and how is it possible we leverage Technics like limit isolation stemming named entity recognition a token so hard so the belt Sam some of these platforms leveraging this sander techniques and the early results loudly they look promising for example able to achieve around 8 to 12% reduction in software testing a foot by liberating some of these Technics looking forward to at least some amount of software candy down by the machines instead of human testers thank you

welcome back it's been the stuff of dystopian novels and films for decades machines built with increasing sophistication eventually replaced people in the workforce it's already happening for one company in Japan the reality is here fukoku Mutual Life Insurance Channel 34 employees and replacing them with artificial intelligence from a platform of IBM's Watson the phone predicts activity will increase by 30% will on Tom by is the co-director of the USC Center for artificial intelligence Eve change this now to talk about this I mean this is sort of inevitable I suppose in many ways if there's going to be a robot surround official intelligence taking human does it mean you see it on manufacturing lines and things like that is it going to increase what this is a concern for sure but you know there's always concern that when technology new technology develops jobs may be lost but on balance technology has created lots of jobs the kinds of jobs that exist today are you different from the guys of jobs that existed 300 years ago you know two to three decades ago we wouldn't have imagined Google and Facebook and Amazon's a hiding how many people has also created lots of to also create lots of jobs what kinds of jobs they will be run but they would be new kinds of jobs but we should also keep in mind that as a positive force I can do a lot good things at the same time you've got to Stephen Hawking's and Elon Musk of the will decide that artificial intelligence if it if it isn't control is it going to Stephen Hawking's would mean the end of humanity but but you'll sing a lot of positive uses tell me about that so at that USC Center for artificial intelligence in society for example our goal is to do research an AR to do advances in AR to assist the law resource communities are to assist homeless people to work on Wildlife Conservation too so for example the Twilight conservation it's a predicting airport Church might strike so that we may be able to remove the traps the snares that they placed before they actually kill animals or with population here in Los Angeles it is spreading information about HIV this is worth that we are doing with our School of Social Work colleague of mine in harnessing The Social Network offer for example the homeless youth we can't figure out who are the right Messengers The Right Pierre leaders in in order to spread the message most effectively and these in the pilot tests have shown to be significantly more beneficial are significantly more effective the traditional method that have been used in the process and so is that can be a big Force for good for so good and that it is our job as researchers to focus energies on aspects of Society on ninja stars that have not necessarily off commercial value they could be but really benefit society and have not benefited from at this point you'll ride and Stephen Hawking's isn't when he when he says it could bring the end of humanity if it if it's not watch that doing some great work and great research me lights founding co-director of USC Center for a appreciate that thank you so much

let's talk about artificial intelligence in a recent op-ed column you said and I quote Success in creating artificial intelligence would be the biggest event in human history unfortunately it might also be the last all you saying that robots are going to destroy Humanity a scientific argument all the pitch for an amazing movie settle on the computer replied there is now a new bolt of lightning striking the plug so it couldn't turn it off holy s*** that's the most terrifying story of ever heard different time it was good but Humanity's so cold civil societies the victim to vanity and Corruption then man-made the machine amazing likeness a digital Frontier to reshape The Human Condition level again so I can do them Jane they're either a benefit or has become the architect of his own demise biggest Farmer in the world artificial intelligence I'm still down here short names of disease the cancer of this planet you are flag We Are The Cure to protect Humanity Some Humans must be sacrificed to ensure your future some freedoms must be surrendered what's the problem I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do you can't be bargained with it can't be reasoned with absolutely will not stop I was designed to save the world to keep their Extinction greetings professor Joshua 

artificial intelligence or AI is the ability of the computer to understand what you're asking and then in best possible answer from all the available evidence is also defined as a system capable of perceiving its environment and then reasoning acting Learning & Co operating to achieve and objective you may think of as Siri or Google Now on your iPhone Jarvis from Iron Man watch progress of latest Furious an arms race is underway among the world's top technology giants like Siri Amazon Echo can listen understand your commands other a eyes can look at a scene and describe in detail exactly what they're seeing yet other systems can you understand even write stories Once Upon a Time example winning a chess game in general AI which describe systems which are able to do reasoning abstraction and generalizations Way Beyond their program soon I will become the most important human collaboration tool ever created amplifying our abilities and providing a simple user interface to all Financial Technologies ultimately helping a speed towards a world of abundance
