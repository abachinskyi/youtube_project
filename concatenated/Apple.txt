people should recognize this is a consumer product story and what's happened here is is that as people identify with the Warren Buffett thesis that this is a razor razor blade company the razor razor is the hard phone the razor blade is the revenue stream that comes from service which wasn't even counted one initially as something that that apple had that I think could only be very important to something that I have heard stand to spend more time talking about I think that apple is still undervalued I think if it got to 180-200 we have to see what the earnings are cuz then I would not feel that it just under play that's the first time I've said that I just don't want to stop to get so far ahead but it is valued at much less than Colgate them Proctor than a Clorox and if you're going to versus consumer products and it does seem cheap

what's up guys Lou here back with another video and today we're going to talk about customizing your Apple watch as you see here I have a third party Band installed on my watch this has like a carbon fiber look with some red stitching it's just a basic band off Amazon I'll actually link it down in the description if you're interested but essentially I've gone ahead and installed this instead of the stock leather band that came with my Apple watch and you're probably wondering how did you do that because I've seen all these different Kickstarter projects for adapters that people are saying are necessary to swap your watch band or or maybe you seen Apple's other bands that are available for purchase independently that started around $200 and go to $600 here to show you the simplest most straightforward way to put any watch band you want on your Apple watch using a simple inexpensive screw what really so this little screwdriver features a pentalobe tip which is quite unusual and probably not in your toolbox Apple has been using this style of screw for a while now on various devices from iPhones to MacBooks and of course now in the Apple watch This Is It can you little version of it I will link this exact model down in the description if you want to do this kind of surgery yourself so before we get into this process I need to mention quickly they didn't how to do a swap out like this independently with your own third-party watch band you'll need to start with the leather watch straps setup from Apple so my recommendation is to purchase an Apple Watch with this band pre-installed therefore the third party options will be configurable with your Apple watch and the reason for is because of the setup the way that this mechanism works on the leather band you have this metallic Loop here that goes through as opposed to some the other band Styles which travel straight into the metallic connector itself and when you remove these you'll notice right away on the leather band setup that you have to screw points here tiny tiny little pentalobe screws upon removing the screws be very careful not to strip them and also not to lose them because as mentioned they are tiny but I'll go ahead and show you what happens when you remove these screws so after removing these screws you'll be left with a few components the 2 screws them what's this metal bar and then this other bar that travels right through the strap itself and connects like this so this part is the key component this is what will enable you to install any watch band any standard watch band that uses this same style and believe me there are tons to choose from so you can set something up that's will you need to yourself no Kickstarter required so reinstalling the strap works exactly the same way as you break it down you just insert these metal rod back into the strap they will connect in the center you'll sort of be able to line that up yourself then you take this connector portion line at backup should fit on very easily then take your tiny little pentalobe screws and at em to fit them in the head and tighten down the screws making sure not to over tighten them but that's really it fairly straightforward to screws can you can put any watch strap you want onto your Apple watch so long as you're starting with the leather band instead of a different one anyway guys there you have it a custom app customize your Apple watch later guys watch strap set up hope you enjoy this content and you found it useful if you did make sure to leave a thumbs-up Down Below subscribe if you haven't yet and I will catch you on the next episode no go

hey guys Mikey or the Detroit board back again with another quick video on the Apple watch at this time we're taking a look at the long-awaited space black Milanese Loop now we've had please black Apple watch since it launched but this is the first time we're getting a matching Milanese Loop now the loop is sold separately for 199 and 38 or 42mm can buy your space black Apple watch with the loop for 699 or 7:49 for the two respective sizes and that's actually what I did here I went out and bought a whole new Apple watch because I don't what is space black Apple watch to match this band Max a big fan of this color can I compare this to the Apple watch I've been wearing for a year which is the stainless steel with the Milanese Loop what color space black is actually a carbon coating on top of stainless steel even though it is a coding it is designed to be extremely durable so although it will scratch won't necessarily scratch to reveal the stainless steel underneath it now the Milanese Loop is made entirely out of stainless steel and all surfaces are coated with this carbon layer as include magnetic watch class which is infinitely adjustable she can really find a comfortable fit really easily the Lord's themselves are also stainless steel and matchup seamlessly with the Apple watch body what is coding on the watch it says a very distinct stainless steel luster which matches seamlessly with a sapphire cover glass now since I've been wearing a Milanese Loop for about a year now I can say it I find it extremely comfortable and durable keeps comfortably to my wrist and Breeze like fabric so I can use this watch and virtually all situations when I'm working out working in the yard I'm just sitting at my desk because I wear it all the time like all my watches he does mean that the polish stainless steel finish has gotten very scratched up as has the magnetic watch clasp base of my wrist however the Milanese Loop shows no signs of obvious where despite my abuse which likely wouldn't be the case for the other watch bands like the leather watch bands are even make bracelets that my only gripe is that the magnetic clasp isn't as secure as it once was which means it loosens up during the day at the Consol readjust it a person I think I prefer frosting with steel which is a little more classic and stands out a bit more like jewelry the Space Blank is more settled and looks a little too similar to the dollar finishes the sport model what do you do you prefer the stainless or the space black finished please let me know in the comments section below or guys will be enjoy this quick vinni if you did please give it a thumbs up to let me know and I'll see you again in the next video

red and Golden Delicious are the two most commonly grown Apple varieties in the world today but did you know that there are over 10,000 different Apple varieties with names today we're going to talk a little bit about some of those unknown ones once you might find in your local farmers market this Friday is Nittany it was developed and Penn State in the 1970s is a search fruited very juicy yellow flesh Apple it's good for pies it's good for sauce it's excellent for eating it ripens about the middle October another variety though this very good is honey crisp and honey crisp was developed at the University of Minnesota it to is a large rooted Apple very Sushi very crisp and can be used primarily for fresh eating it is described or has been described as being explosively crisp this third variety is called jonagold it was developed in New York from a cross between Jonathan and Golden Delicious and name jonagold this cross was made back in the 1940s unfortunately the apple variety never became popular United States had to go to Europe in front of Europe improve very and then came back to the states is Crest high quality very juicy occasionally you'll see it in the grocery store but more commonly is available roadside markets you can grow your own high-quality apples in your backyard if use the right varieties this Friday here is called Sun it was developed by Purdue Rutgers in Illinois it ripens early October it's a high-quality crisp firm texture yellow apple best for eating one of the main points of the be good for you is that it is resistant to Apple scab there are number of varieties that have recently been released that are Apple scrap for more information about those contact your local County Extension Office another new variety that you may see in grocery stores is called pink lady pink lady was developed in Australia and reasons called pink lady is the fact that the skin develops a really nice pink blush on it it is very high quality find textured fruit that keeps for a long time in a semi sweet and can be eaten fresh and let me talk about another variety that actually who's up to its name Pink and that's variety called pink pearl this Friday's actually heirloom variety many many years ago it's only recently been rediscovered it's called pink pearl is because like a pearl it's pink inside it's very tart it's only available do limited quantities in some stores but it is very good apple I'm so we can share y'all 10,000 varieties but I hope that when you're out this fall you stop in your low roadside market and see what the first do they have in taste and appearance to offer you a copy of the program you've just can be purchased through Penn State media sales at media sales.

tinkle tinkle ppap IHOP a pen I have an apple Apple pen I have a pen I have pineapple pineapple pen Apple pen pineapple Apple Okay Google pineapple apple pear 

the first Apple watches today we buy them just like you do we ordered 8 but got sick this morning evenly split between the stainless steel Apple watch like the one that I've got here add the aluminum Apple watch sport we didn't have everspring for the 18 karat gold $10,000 plus Apple watch Edition today in our labs are going to be testing for heart rate step count ease-of-use water resistance and scratch test which is happening right behind me now we put the watches under our abrasion tester and we use pics that are calibrated to the Mohs hardness scale a scientific standard the heart of the pick the more likely it is just surface we start scratching with a pic that's almost as hard as a penknife then we go to the next hardest pick in the scale and we keep doing that until we can see and feel damn Apple watch sport made with ion X glass didn't scratch when we use pics that were about as hard as a penknife and a steel now but it didn't scratch when we use text it's not as hard as a masonry drill bit the stainless steel Apple watch made with sapphire crystal didn't even scratch him use the hardest pick we have the traits in number on the Mohs scale just under Diamond advertising how deep you can go in the water with your Apple watch but in a website footnote Apple says that the watch has a water resistance ipx7 under IEC standard 60529 and being submerged in three feet of water for 30 minutes so we put two watches one sport in one non sport model to the test are tank was pressurized to simulate three feet of water 30 minutes under water both are still fully functional but will continue to monitor them for any animalities rate monitor here Consumer Reports wearing both are casters hit the treadmill first walking slowly then a little faster than a jog then back to a walk all the they periodically reported the heart rate waiting on the Apple watch we found the watch to be accurate it were no significant differences between its readings and that of the reference mod these are our initial findings on day one of our apple.watch ownership other tests we perform take more time for our step test ran since we mapped around around are Atrium that are testers are go anywhere in the Apple watch and carry in the counter those results are now getting statistically analyze mean time will also finish our usability testing that includes how easy it is go to watch with your phone how well you can read the display in bright light and low life and how easy it is to use different functions like the clock the alarm email messaging and notifications Rocky with the rest of our scientific results in short order and will tell you how the Apple watch Stacks up against other smart watches in our new ratings category 



like with John sculley John came from PepsiCo and they they at most would change their product in once every 10 years I mean to them a new product like a new size bottle so if you are a product person you couldn't change the course that company very much so who influence the success of PepsiCo sales and marketing people therefore they were the ones that got promoted and therefore they would have once it ran the company well for PepsiCo that might have been okay but it turns out the same thing can happen in technology companies that get monopolies like oh I BM and Xerox if you were a product person at IBM or Xerox so you make a better copy or a better computer so what when you have a monopoly market share the company is not any more successful so the people that can make the company more successful are sales and marketing people and they end up running the companies and the product people get driven out of the decision-making forums and the companies forget what it means to make grape rod it sort of the product sensibility in the product genius that brought them to that monopolistic position gets rodded out by people running these companies who have no conception of a good product versus a bad product they have no conception of a craftsmanship that's were to take a good idea and turn it into a good product and they really have no feeling in their hearts usually about wanting to really help the customers so that's what Xerox that the people of Xerox Parc used to call the people that ran Xerox toner heads 

yes Jonathan here in 2015 is almost to an animal Before We Say Goodbye let's take a look at some of Apple's most questionable design decisions so first up is the 12 in Mac this is not me hating on the machine I actually like it a lot but the inclusion of one single USB C Port boggles my mind because that if using a hub or converted us going to stop do something as basic as charging your computer at the same time now this is a knock against USBC it's just a fact of this is the sole port on the computer and something as simple as adding a second we make a huge difference following that is the Magic Mouse 2 in is not really much needs to be said I think this really Paints the picture and yes I know it only takes what is the charge for the fact that this is how you do that really showcases the fact that Apple didn't want to take the extra steps put in the extra work and really eat the extra cost to make this a much more of fish next up is the apple pencil and that's so much the pencil itself even though it's pricey as hell I think for when it's geared for does a fantastic job but more so the way you charge the thing is ridiculous 20th century Las primeras of use a lightning connector that you recharged by plugging directly into iPad Pro you are so beyond just looks this worries the hell out of me that I'm going to accidentally knocked us over and snap that lightning Port the last episode of the Apple kind of surprised everyone with an is there iPhone battery case I first glance that looks like the iPhone case swallowed a baby iPad and what frustrates me most about this is the laziness and design essentially ruined they put really cool product if it didn't look ridiculous or actually out of a peeling and Coulomb's to this case the first about being is a fact that it actually has a lightning Port if you messed around with any of these third play battery packs even the more expensive ones like Mophie the problem with those is that using USB cable so if you're heavily invested into the Apple world have tons of lightning cables that is one more cable you need to way around the other really appealing Factor about this case as a fact that it works in unison with your phone's not only can you see the battery life on your phone but I'll see your case as well do they notify is pull down from there you can slap back into reality with frustration due to the fact there is not an on or off port on this case whatsoever so that means you have no control of when you want charge or not charge your phone and I don't know why Apple would include something as basic as an on-off switch last settings really emphasize what I was talking about with apple being lazy on there too turn this year they brag about how they're able to make custom special batteries for the 12-inch MacBook to keep that in so why couldn't they do something similar for this case if you look towards the top and the bottom is still when do the space left awaken the flatness out fill in the rest of the space and make this nice flat and uniform obviously we're never going to know the exact answer but I think it really comes down to app back on an extra mile or maybe they normally would have before size about the rest of the video hopefully guys enjoyed it if you did and you are feel like me awesome make sure to go Santa on that like button death describes you having at this is day three of The Twelve Days of TLD this is Jonathan and I will catch you guys later 





for the end of last year after a set of field trials actually in Washington state last fall the two of us decided that the technology was at a point play sense to move from research to actually developing a commercial system so there a lot of systems to be designed built prototypes tested and we're just continue cycling through that so going from the technology concept that can accomplish that the previously was not possible to a commercial system involves a lot of hard work a lot of detailed engineering and a lot of testing this really no substitute for getting in orchardson you can actually work in the field so every time there's a harvest will be somewhere in the world where we can can take advantage of that Harvest so we plan to continue to alternate between the Northern Hemisphere and the southern hemisphere as we going to cycle through development robotic systems have number of facets to them one of them is depressed system recovery dad to see apples in this case from leaves and Trunks and twigs and and isolate them as individual apples and localized where rat in the canopy substance are there so many polation side part of it is getting it off of the tree so how can you get in there and invasive what does the Apple off of the tree without damaging it based on where the perception system tells you to do and then beyond that once you got the Apple then how do you get it all the way into a van so those are the main areas where we've done some Innovative work Intel we think he has made the difference between being able to do it or not what percentage is that you can pick apples without damaging apples and without damaging treats its simply of this is a type of a typo produce that has not been possible to make before because there's always been kind of using the chemical systems is always been too much damage to the fruit we're using vacuum in a unique way to to get apples off of trees and then you know make sure that it's we harvested and get it into a bin that through on Skype so we're still working through the the steps to do that so we're at in The Orchards this fall will be in Washington state for 5 to 6 weeks September October harvesting in a number of different conditions different types of orchards different varieties of fruit are girls to have a commercial system ready within the next two years

Christina what do you make of Apple's push even further into the health space a secret team that was building products for people with diabetes and specifically they were trying to do non-invasive and continuous glucose monitoring and then we learn that Tim Cook has been wearing one of these devices around the Apple campus and he spoke about that in Scotland when a dressing room full of students and how help I've been for him personally what a pain it was for people with diabetes to do this kind of tracking every single day so what what did he say when when he was speaking in Scotland about that well he said that he had been tracking his blood sugar for weeks and that he learning how the foods that he was eating if there specially if they were high and Sugar We're impacting his blood sugar and all of that was leading him to make healthier decisions and we seen Tim Cook on a little bit of a health spree recently he's an average and go and just told Jim Cramer that he's lost 30 lbs but beyond that this could be a text future products because we we heard that he was wearing a prototype on the Apple watch a potentially of a future version of the watch in that we could see latest tracking adding two things like steps to Tim and talk about how accurate it is and whether or not they would need FDA approval if it came to Market he did not talk about that but suddenly they would need FDA approval if they were building a device of their own right now what they can do is they can connect existing after I approved gross motor doesn't have that day to show up on a device like the phone or the Apple watch but this would be a big new step for Apple if they would build earned sensors in house and for that we have to see them getting into a regulated space seitan all of the day's biggest stories you can also click on any of the videos around me to watch the latest from CNBC thanks for watching

Apple's logo is one of the most iconic ever designed if so econic in fact that it's often displayed without any text yet it still instantly recognizable that wasn't always the case however in fact the original logo started out looking far different from the one where custom to today this is the first Apple logo Sir Isaac Newton in a quote from William Wordsworth around the edges it was a Sign by Apple's third founder Ronald Wayne it's all used on the cover Apple 1 operations manual in an apple ads time would it be interesting if Apple kept this logo up until the present of course that was not put on logo wear custom to today we have this man to think Rob Jenna who was a designer for an ad agency what direction from Apple was to quote not make it cute for a classic looking out they'll silhouette with a bite taken out of it to give it a sense of scale so no-one mistook for a cherry tomato the rainbow stripes represent the Apple 2 ability to display in color Appleton really fully embraced the bite in the beginning though seen this Apple One manual there's no bite taken out of the apple or this Apple 2 carrying case also featuring a full apple apple use this logo really unchanged until the late 90s the only changes they made was to make it slightly more symmetrical it did however get smaller and smaller on their products Asda anesthetics got more more modern Apple did finally update their logo shortly after return of Steve Jobs to the aqua look that doesn't it a lot more sense are products such as the newly-introduced iMac and the G4 Cube the final update they made was the switch from the aqua to the glass Style add this would greet you every time you turn on and iOS device build the technology is on has changed drastically the local itself has remained motiv Lee unchanged over last 30 years besides as minor tweaks we talked about which I think is a true Testament to just how iconic it is

for this video I'm going to show you a faster safer and more convenient way to cut your apples to start turn your apples upside down she can see the tops have a lot more surface area than the bottoms so by putting them face down they'll be a lot more stable when you cut them meaning less chance you cut yourself instead next rather than cutting an when the quarters like you're probably taught to do imagine the Tic Tac Toe pattern with the center of the grid lining up with the middle of the Apple cut along these imaginary lines holding the pieces together firmly of the can you do and just like that your fruit snack is completely sliced and ready to eat the cool thing about this method is if I keeping the pieces together it'll actually stay good for a surprising amount of time I open this one three hours later and you can see it still in really great shape ready to be so think about this the next time you're packing a lunch try snapping rubber band around the outside and you'll healthy snack ready to go in an instant the best part is you don't even need an extra baggy now if you're serving your Apple snacks at home here's a cool little trip to try with the corner pieces cut Agnes lives across the Apple slice and One Direction then spin it around and cut three more slips the same way so they meet near the bottom with a flick of your fingers you can offset the pieces to make a fun and could have way to serve healthy snacks in a way that everyone will love of course if you want to take your Apple artwork to the next level you can easily cut and rearrange one single Apple into an edible apple swan try to make this in another project video not just for fun I decided to compare apples to apples with 3 different methods to see the difference in how they Brown overtime the pieces at the to completely untreated and we'll be left out so they're exposed to the air but I slice these other two apples tic-tac-toe style and found them together with rubber bands to protect them the only difference between these she was at the one on the left is treated with lemon juice some people say that the citric acid lemon juice will prevent your apples from oxidizing and turning brown let's find out whether or not that's true eight and a half hours later let's take a look and see what's happened to them it looks like all the slices explosive year did turn brown after all and don't look nearly as appetizing but by keeping this license healthy clear with the rubber band the apple and the right only Brown just a little in for sitting out nearly 9 hours it still looks impressively edible if we begin side of the one Spritz with lemon juice you can see it looks just fresh as the minute we cut it and still taste just as good as well not for one last experiment I set up a time trial to see which method of cutting the apples really is faster and just for your convenience I will speed it up a little amazingly you can see all 8 slices Orkut and only 10 seconds and there's very little mess to clean up at all on the other hand it's nearly five along with the traditional techniques in there chunks of albacore everywhere will now you know a faster safer and more convenient way to cut your apples that will not only save you time but won't leave the mess for you to clean up later that's it for now if you like this video perhaps you like some others check them out at the king of random.com haggai the hope you learn can you orally saw something you like thank you so much for watching and sharing my videos that is exactly why you are the best now if you're in the mood to see another project video just click here to go back one or to go forward you know some other favorite projects by clicking on any of these if clicking the screen isn't working just looked down in the description I put all the links down there as well including links to some my favorite playlist thanks again for watching sharing and supporting my videos and I will see you in the next one talk to you then
