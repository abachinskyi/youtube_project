I want you to do to me when I'm swimming in the sea want to do me name the sea 

how many miles you got left what kind of times does do because we just ran back-to-back 11 443 is really enough I don't know why I was pretty cool what model is this p85d ludicrous got you hopefully we can never get to see him at the strip so it's not cool to see we're one of the very few people that fight bring them out like we LOL hahaha no way this is the 1105 people that that's exactly right I mean there's not much to do with this car now call the address I'll take the way I can honestly say to the first time I've ever seen that in time I've done it first time I've seen it myself so I wasn't what I expected hope for but I'll take the win what was your words yeah like a .13 or so hit like a point to something so he is going to get me on the big and if you can yeah well congratulations and thank you 
what what happens when you when Tesla says no when you say hey can we borrow a 100 d 100d Model S Deanna p90d the p90d is mine but a lot of those naysayers out there we're saying you know it's not the best Tesla two-year-old Tesla soap what's the best one p100d just came out it has 600 miles on it so I don't want to hear anybody out there saying you know that it's like a loose battery pack it's full charged which are going to run that against our trash car here over the funds to go right you going to go right totally stopped and then got it totally stopped let's see what this in does Village 60 years old and I'll put a smile on your face rabbit what has more cameras more cameras in my p90d if you look there's like cameras here and cameras right up here and Scott it seems to just seems to drive on autopilot lot better play me like that Miss Thing Man performance 100 kilowatt hour dual motor it's going to retail for 148 148-150 financing lure 200 all but you get $7,500 and if you calculate the gas savings but this is a car though I mean snow mighty what are things like is it too late for that just like this the right you push the gas search the front of his right you get angry I'm ready for Monday's shoot we shouldn't somethings we can do 

it was really important to create a an electric car that was better than any gasoline car to hello then Tissa to get rid of the misconceptions if he will have to run electric cars so we needed to create one that was better in every way if electric car is done right it is actually a better car than a gas changing and people look back in the future I'm guessing action cars like they currently look back on steam engines mobile projection vehicle is almost become like this living breathing thing I want people to still look at this vehicle and think how is that being done now how's that possible we knew we wanted to make a mobile projector vehicle but no one ever have done that to a Tesla started off by adding 15000 Lumen video projector that's mounted on a robotic arm that deploys up out of the back of the car Thursday Electrolux and paint job which is the first-of-its-kind so that paint actually missed light so we can do different pattern want a man patterns is to represent the pattern on a bioluminescent fish in the ocean and then in the front of the car we installed in the front thermal imaging camera that pops up out of the front and has a special filter on it that allows you to see Carm Dockside emissions so that's illegal got to stop it until you push that have any of my race cars I feel like I'm driving the future around to get to drive that really really cool that is unlike any other on the planet it's so amazing nature to the city mobile inspire people to help save these creatures

sometimes I don't trust love at first sight not even when a car looks disc good so I decided to put the Tesla Model X through its Paces for five days in the mountains along the fornia Coast I needed to know was this just a crush or a lasting love affair I first drove the $151,000 SUV briefly in Los Angeles last year and at the time thought it was one of the best cars I've ever tested but a 340 Mile Road can make or break any relationship one push of the button and the model X will automatically write your trip according to where the Super Chargers lineup it probably won't did the fastest route but you know you won't run out of juice we were on our way it was a start of something beautiful the seats are rated High inside but they're easy to access even the back row and the interior cabin is so quiet I can hear crickets chirping outside as I drove with the Wind the car has almost no body roll around corners and it handled beautifully on a Sandy Beach I will say the battery gauge can be deceiving it doesn't decrease at a stable rate so you can jump down and range a lot quicker than you expect let this morning and we've been driving for 4 hours or so so we're down to about 77 miles on the battery so I asked the car to find us the supercharger and we're driving there now and we should get there in about 12 minutes turns out I had some major time to kill hey Grandma oh nothing much how are you on the road I could focus on the feel of the all-wheel drive test the three point two seconds 0 to 60 mile-per-hour Sprint time and a 762 equivalent horsepower if feels really fast when you push down the Gas Pedal the brakes are regenerative so you have to get used to their different feel I never really did turn the automatic front doors can be tricky they open when you least expect it at the end of this trip I realize the real question here is not should you buy this car but do you want to join the electric lifestyle you really do feel virtuous when you drive it no fossil fuels here but owning an electric car saps your time and energy if you're not delivered about charging it makes it harder to be spontaneous and free and you have to be okay with bring up the Rob pure feeling of driving in mechanical car but if you are that kind of driver the kind that wants to be on The Cutting Edge of luxury and Technology you're going to turn left 

and wait for him to give us the go signal and then we'll go holy smokes p85d with a lot of talking about those near the 60 and 3.2 seconds pretty quick you need to get up at the traffic where do I put my phone so most of the gas and brake and steering wheel drives on its own and you can watch it or read the speed limit sign so we can crease speed from 25 to 30 plain white one in following the light White Lines it goes over starts doing the lane change and we'll come up to a stop here on its own I have nothing I'm not do any inputs here. 5D with the autopilot any of them all lesson doesn't have to do a motor that we're showing off tonight but every car has this 
an earlier Tesla received a very rough ride from the BBC's Top Gear program next up all the PVC with pumpkins brush Kentucky was even on the BBC so what do you think of Jeremy Clarkson Clarkson Clarkson show is much more about entertainment than is about truth and I think most people realize that but not everyone and a lot of his shows so it's not as though I just hate Top Gear or anything he can be very funny when an irreverent but he does have a strong bias against electric cars any particular seems hate American like his two pet peeves are Americans American cause electric cause an American electric car in the worst possible situation for someone like Clarkson sweetie this is a reactivity Eurovision trying to convert Jeremy Clarkson

for the past week I've been try Chevy Volt today I get to drive a Tesla Model S full disclosure we're not going to try to set it on fire we will however say what an extra $60,000 gets you in the Tesla it comes to Performance the vault is no match for the model S the volt will go 0 to 60 miles per hour in about 9 seconds the model S will do it in under if you're driving the most powerful version same goes for top speed you can get a bolt up to about a hundred miles an hour Tesla will hit 130 now the Chevy Volt plug-in hybrid electric vehicle which means it can run on both electricity and gasoline so the volts on a full charge will get 30 to 40 miles once you start count gasoline can go about 300 which is close to a conventional car the model S is pure electric which means you don't have any gasoline but you can go in this model what's the 265 miles and that's the EPA rating which accounts for more aggressive and more economically friendly points of driving or the volts infotainment some offers plenty of options it's just not that good but the infotainment system in the Tesla Model S may be the most advanced you can get in the car today you can browse radio see where you're going with Google Maps monitor how much energy you're using browse the web get a hi-rez view of behind you and even connect your phone while the volt seats only for you can get up to 7 people in the Tesla if you go for the two rear facing seats in the trunk they are however really just meant for children but the fault is a really nice car I like The Styling the performance is more than adequate and being able 30 miles on a single charge of electricity really isn't bad if you wanted as a computer car but if you want a car that can really perform they can hit a hundred thirty miles an hour at the great idea in most situations and I can go from 0 to 60 and under 5 seconds and you're willing to put down about $60,000 more for this level of Model S

Tesla is making a bet that an enormous five billion dollar gigafactory will solve a problem that the power industry has so far failed at to create a cost-effective battery to store Electrolux on a massive scale it starts with small backup systems for people with rooftop solar great for those who want to live entirely Off the Grid but that's a tiny market for household still connected to the grid the batteries aren't yet cheap enough to make economic sense there's a much bigger Market Tesla is going after businesses and utilities here's why in the next five years solar power will make up more than 50 California's electricity during the sunniest part of the day and then provide no power at night batteries could help even out the power supply by storing Electrolux D from off-peak hours to be used during Peak demand hours Shifting the peak would cut utility bills for businesses like Walmart which are already testing systems some utilities are also eager to build battery storage power companies must maintain so-called peeker expensive facilities that set idle for most of the year but are needed when electricity demand is greatest batteries could replace some paper plants while strengthening the grid the cost of batteries is falling as fast as the cost of solar panels very fast the tiny new energy storage industry is about to break open and whether it's from Tesla or one of its many emerging competitors some electricity from your outlet May soon be coming from the

Tesla has made the electric car mainstream so far there hasn't been a standard-bearer in the two wheeled world we have the zero here in the US and Grandma but now out of both Natalie we have the inertia ego the first time I've ever ridden a motorcycle to a gas station and not needed to tank up let's see how it drives the hard part is keeping it light you can go into the halftime 569 pounds that's a third more than fully fueled Ducati 848 but the big bonus is in the battery provides 144 ft pounds of torque more than twice as much as the body lets plecos for $34,000 now marzocchi Forks up front and olenchock Outback and Oz Wheels but the best part about this Italian Superbike is it traditional tubular trellis frame the most about riding this bike is the sound hit did dictive the high whale speed II hear from a jet playing against higher and higher the faster you go it does take awhile to get used to this but there's no clutch there's not even any shift lever down here but it's all worth it once you twist the throttle and there's are going to make 300 spikes but it's not enough for you there is a more limited edition model for $68,000 the eagle 45 goes on sale next pranks 

can I'm going to demonstrate the auto park feature of the Tesla and I see a little parking spot up there between the black and the and I'm going to drive it slowly up there I believe you to drive 18 miles an hour or less until the little pea appears in the instrument panel have you passed about 3 or 4 feet past this car in front and the little pee comes up there it is it's up it's right there the little pea that they detect the parking spot available I'm going to put in reverse and then the camera comes up on the 8th that 17 inch panel the parking spot right there's a start button and that's another bad news is not at this time so I'm going to like over everything let go of everything in the car is going to start moving backwards if we go making noise behind the steering wheel but it does it perfectly every single time it's about 6 inches two way from the curb forward a tiny bit maybe about a foot-and-a-half to feet and it's Auto Parts complete Frank this Fierce we're done

when Tesla introduces in Utah the world goes crazy with excitement is one of the most hotly anticipated Tech and Automotive Products and this isn't kind of underwhelming looks exactly the same as the old car because it is everything that's new is inside on a saw turn off date go to notification saying an update is ready I accepted it took about 45 minutes and then the whole of the inside of my car is like it in Thai vehicles on the road running model axial ax this car is not running version 8.0 it's Tesla's late to Salt Palace Pizza version the weeds when given an early look at it's almost 17 inch screen here in the center this is why you interact with your Tesla and this is what you see all the differences first thing I notice is that everything looks a bit more modern and a bit flatter the music interface is much nicer his local is streaming radio or you can listen to your own phone still don't very many controls for your own phone Maps up here aware things look really can navigate and one touch I'm just going to go to the Wyatt office which is not very far away from here I'm just now made it so these icons at the top will actually go away so the map will take up the entire screen area and really give you this if you any which is used when you're navigating there is a downside to that and that these buttons are than hidden and slightly how this get to you have to tap the screen twice and order to pull down the Atlantic or whatever else you want voice recognition is been improved with an accent that something that I definitely appreciate now you just tap the button and then yeah I can say navigate to the nearest Starbucks and rice on the screen what I said got it and then on the maps over on the center screen it brings up a list of all the Starbucks the nearby one of those functional improvements private display when I activate autopilot it now shows me the speed at set to very clearly and a bright blue circle show Auto steering is on the cars keeping itself in a and that is an improvement that a lot of people been asking for it makes it much clearer when the system is an isn't active and one of the best things about a whole new interface at least it gives you something to look at and play with while you're sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic

Tesla Motors will reach a major Milestone tonight the company will unveil its first electric car intended from mainstream buyers the model 3 base price is 35 dollars that is about half the price of some other Tesla models this is an important moment for CEO Elon Musk expects Tessler to make a profit starting this year CBS News Financial contributor mellody Hobson is with as from Chicago Melody good morning good morning is this a game changer for Tesla and for the Auto industry as you mention the company has not been profitable despite the stock price and they really are expecting this to be there several several bullet Forbes estimates that 30% of the value of Tesla will be derived from the sales of this when they kick in in 2017 so this is a game-changer for them for the industry I'm not so sure that your Tesla will make something like a hundred thousand cars 17 Platinum cars are sold in the United States next year it'll still be less than 200,000 cars so in terms of The Big Industry story there still saw small play so who do they think Melody is going to buy this car probably the tech-savvy early adopter environmentally conscious person who lives in the suburbs or the city this is not the car for a rural buyer because the charging stations aren't everywhere so it's the people who are me a commuter car for people you talk about a commuter car before people didn't seem to mind the delays now are they ready to keep up with production to give people the commuter car right away the big question so the model as the luxury car was delayed the model X the SUV was delayed for almost two years the early cards were supposed to be shipped in two 13 they came last fall so that's the big issue with this car they need to ramp up production for 50,000 of these cars next to your the one way they say they'll be able to do that they built their own battery Factory called the gigafactory it's been built right now it's early in production and this Factory will help them be able to deal with the production delays that they bad they said have been largely due to being able to buy those batteries and Asia it is a major step so from that perspective Tesla has let the way their cars have been extraordinary popular very well received in terms of car Enthusiast and so people are expecting this car to be another breakthrough moment I talk to an auto executive who said we expect Tesla to fate this was an odd executive than the victory the question is can the execute that's the question Melody did you see the story right before you the reunion go eight hours watching her face and they were coming out to you such a sweet sweet story good2cu mellody Hobson always 

let's see how it works first set cruise control set your speed as you normally would I'm not holding the whale my hands to the whale how do I take a pulling out put on this indicator on touch the wheel here so I can I use that I'm around you can say I'm not doing anything that I'm moving the wheel just applying send Susan the wheel of move that seem to see in Middle Lane Atlanta come on later the time it went do it Wednesday if you need the indicator on it wouldn't come can move mountains outside Lane let's move back again and again hold the wheel not turning it just applying pressure settings on there and move back into the inside Lane indicates of how may continue on our way at 65 miles an hour I'm going to say it's a very small system what takes a little bit of getting used to but once you do get the hang of it it's very easy to operate it makes me to a cruising very very easy and it's a slightly feeling to have the wheel turn without you putting any rotation on it whatsoever it really is the closest thing to ortona driving then you can get go to say Starin but it's something in your blind spot or need something knowing your blind spots when you haven't spotted let's see what it will do no it's not moving it is now Jesse says they already working on updates at the moment this called Kong free zone recognize traffic signs speed limit signs or traffic lights you can't use it to Putin town it's a mix way cyst but working on updates and it will roll those out over the coming years it will take pilot system itself East sleep with age this cold is actually getting better the older it gets okay I called help thinking but one of those interesting things is that Tesla can update the car even existing cough it's thrown out the only day that you'll call become 



if there is one car that people are talking about this year the Canadian International Auto Show it's this one right here this is Tesla's model it's their brand new 7-passenger SUV 0 to 100 in 3.4 seconds check out the back doors Falcon Wing doors Isn't that cool let's see if we can open the front doors cuz this was a little tricky for me here just a quick press opens automatically come on inside and take a look so this is the first chance you're going to get to actually see and feel and smell and get a taste for the model X because is the first time it's been shown at an auto show is making its Auto Show debut here in Canada check out the cockpit cuz that's really what it feels like here you've got this huge heads up display right in the middle here it's about the size of a laptop almost far bigger than a tablet on this display you can actually you know what we did with the doors you can what was the by pressing a button on here or you can also close them automatically by pulling that handle Isn't that cool interesting that a lot of the buzz of the Canadian Auto Show what about an electric car this year because this year has really been the year of the truck and the SUV far less fuel-efficient vehicles because of course this year the price of gas is Humboldt we've had record Auto Sales and those Auto Sales have been driven in large part by the sales of big trucks and big SUVs because of course the minute it costs less to pull up Canadians it seems will buy those big vehicles but if they want a car that is electric that has zero emissions that goes like I zero to 100 in about 3.4 seconds this is the one they want to buy a course you can't buy it just yet you have to place an order and you need at least to be able to afford that six-figure price tag but if you can well it's pretty sweet ride I'm Erin Saltzman CBC News

okay folks here we are we're going to do a little demo of the Tesla Model S hidden menu screen we're not Model S performance right now down here we got the rather up showing the local weather and hear some energy consumption we've done over the past fifteen Miles or so but the real interesting part where is at the top you can see the Tesla logo here and what we're going to do is press on this for a few seconds I know we like our new screen pops up here that says please enter your access code so after the passwords put in correctly you'll see the first screen show up and you can see some settings are not normally available in the Model S specifically looking at the Drake sport torque and limit top speed those options are not normally available in the main menu are the next Green here you can see under the app section some apps they're not available yet there's an image viewer sketch pad which might be for drawing on the 17-inch touchscreen there's a schedule at icon that looks kind of like can I tell can I bike on there and there's also some other testing things here if that animation test audio test voice recognition and some navigation test as well the next Green here shows the car configuration which some interesting points here are the blind spot detection adaptive cruise control and the lane departure warning all of which are currently not available in the model S but certainly would be desirable features to have and it looks like Tesla definitely has these in the works I guess we'll hope to see them soon the fourth screen here which I think I've seen around before looks like a die plastic screen showing status and temperatures of the battery HVAC system temperatures of the motors the drive inverter as well as I some other features here 

what's going on everybody we're back here for a great episode and as you can see there's another Tesla in front of me and if you can see the side panel real quick Papa p85d in front of us that's the only means that this is the new p100d from Tesla very soon we're definitely going to race these things together best side of the quarter mile drag strip where to go I don't know where he went definitely has a lot more top-end and where's that I'm losing you so far back right now we driving this car and have probably the coolest at out there right now if we started out going 11 sevens with are 11 sixes on average and are PewDiePie 11 V 9 which is currently as our members still the fastest p85d Insane Mode run over and then now with the p90d we're running 10 Apes which is still the only Tesla to officially break it to the tens at the drag strip which is crazy what this thing is going to run but for Tesla to increase their speed over a whole full second and just two years that's a lot for a call in a whole second at the drags what mall is a ridiculous amount of speed I don't know where these cars are going in the future but they're definitely around to stay and they're only getting Faster by the second we got to stop light if that wasn't the most even start over he's getting lost back there you floored this car for a few seconds you losing your license enjoyed this video stick around with got some big things coming comparing these car is that an official drag strip as of now I'm very lucky to be taking off of work right now and I'm going back to work sadly enough I'll see you on a few days for another video I am 

this is the first time I've seen it I know some of the differences get me the opening here what there is no hair in the chair or else maybe on the hill somewhere over there but I have to see over here because I was told that this one is like Air flight for tonight and probably noticed something where is the from there or their play better protect against no one night and no problem but let me see what is car OKC are there is no pocket let me see okay under the seat belts are not adjustable like mulch can I see the same Blendtec be in sync so what I see now Kennedy okay so this is LED light yeah like Molex from has the adoptive stuff as well so I know one difference in the back here for the same but you probably know this this this one used to be black Baltic what are the meanest plastic it was it was black on the mall before it is now the same color as the car that's pretty cool here the diffuser is gone the metal one is gone there's one is plastic so what actually no I think there's a diffusive it right but that the whole methyl thing is called plastic can go over here take a look I still have the same sensors but on the net front again front is cool cool what is new with this car is the LED headlights and the HEPA filter I don't have any crazy changes on it so what does coolest cool first time I seen it 

we have a 6mm thick armor place on the bottom of the car and actually punch through that then armor plate and into the the battery pack a crushed seller several the battery cells it took several minutes but eventually those those Tails quote fire and what's your of the modules for battery pack phone so that's what happened but the drive was able to close the side of the road get out some cool to buy stop Benson if they know anything play Sven about making calls being a Boston BW said he was startled those the word to you that was what he is startled by the fire I don't know because the BW has thousands of car fires every year he's investing a lot of money in this technology he says he's the safe again I don't even that is MW literally has several thousand fires every year and their feet Africa throwing story do you think that you are going to get as the result of the technology that's been used I clearly you know the Dreamliner flying up at 37000 feet is it more in the spotlight now than it has ever been in the ocean is higher for a new technology than for an existing technology was not record for no reason anything like that was doing in a normal flight and it just so you're not case if it was hit by a large piece of metal at high speed and if that were to stay punch to the gasoline tank or gas tank supply lines the car would have been in a confirmation when would have been burnt to the ground

well it's a beautiful sunny -32 degrees right now yes it is next cold and here's the beauty of driving electric car it is over 100 degrees warmer inside my car right now Senators outside the temperature inside my car is a balmy 90 degrees going to have to start anything then all I did was turn on the heater from inside the comfort of my house while it was plugged in with my iPhone strong power from the grid so I don't lose any range in the nice thing about having a 90 something to drink power when it's negative 32 out is any snow or actually if it snows at all pretty much the Snows in the ices Itself by the time you come out to your car no need to scrape the windshield no need to brush snow off turn it to wipe off the door handles just hop in I'm plugged first hop in and go simple Zach never drive a nice car again supplies two three done that is all the prep work to get when is -32 degrees outside and I do think my genitals are now thoroughly Frozen to the side of my leg let's start the diesel process I want that no hard cranking no no issues trying to start the car put into drive and we're moving how about that I like this 2010 Lincoln MKT which is currently been plugged into a block warmer for oh I don't know about 5 hours now to try and saw the thing enough so it would start and it still won't start battery is charged up just Nana power so well I'm sorry I couldn't do my urgently playing video supercharging an overnight charging it just got way too cold and are we had about a negative 58 degrees wind chill and my tire looks a little low now that it is this cold out and I did verify on Saturday when it was about 32 without that I did have proper inflation so that is due to the insanely cold weather can't beat it on the other hand I don't think that one's going anywhere for quite a while Barrios

the report obtained by CBS This Morning claims that electric-car maker testers production growth might be coming at the expense of workers safety the analysis was conducted by the safety advocacy group called work safe to report shows in 2015 the number of recordable injuries at Tesla Factory in Fremont California was 31 can higher than the industry average the rate of serious injuries are there was about double the industry rate that year and it statement tells us as this we may have had some Chow who's in the past but with changes we now have the lowest injury rate in the industry by far Carter Evans spoke with some of the employees making the accusations what is the chief complaint here Andrews are the number one problem there did you ever tell any managers about this looked at me as if was a complainer 

it's the most exciting thing I mean you get in that car and you just smile ear-to-ear you know what I love about it is I have this Green Halo when you drive an electric car but forget the Halo that thing is fun it's a blast it it doesn't seem to make that's because we think about electric cars as being slow and awkward and clumsy what's it like to actually drive it lightning fast so fast I have a confession I left the Tesla Center driving on the freeway had no idea till I looked down I was going 93 miles an hour it glide's so smoothly so quietly do you have no sense of speed and I've already learned you make sure you're looking at that I'm going to see flashing lights behind you from the police by now everyone is saying wow I want to buy one this isn't an ad for Tesla you're a hard-nosed they were reporter there are some inconvenient things about it and one is the cost we should make that clear hostage gigantic what is it cost well you can start this thing about 70,000 and run it up to about 115,000 US Dollars before any tax credits rate u.s. dollars so I bought mine long ago before the price went up 9 because of tax credits I was eligible for netted out at a still outrageous 44,000 $700 you got a break from the US government on it you've got a great car you got a long trip ahead of you II inconvenient thing even can afford this car is literally how far you can drive it where you can gas it up it's an electric cars need fuel but tell us about the energy to run this well you have a Pack batteries it's almost like a zillion cell phone batteries from the front to the back in the middle below and can you charge it fully up depending on which version you buy you can go 160 miles 240 miles or 320 miles on a single charge so if you go for the real high-end and you have a 320 mile range that's essentially five hours at freeway speeds in the car and then you'd have to stop and you got to charge it and with the Tesla if you get an option that allows high speed charging and a half hour you can get back to another 160 miles range but you're stuck for a half hour eating a meal or whatever but you can literally plug it into the wall at a gas station or hotel or a friend's house sadly no you need a special charger in Tesla has set up strategically in the Northeast us and from California to Washington State on both highly travel quarters these high speed charging stations they let use for free but can't go anywhere and do it if you're planning a a beautiful drive through Bavaria or you want to go across the Sahara at 150 miles an hour you're out of luck lucky about where you got electric car now is a Pioneer I bought a Nissan Leaf that I have two years ago that was very very pioneer Days Inn so over time we'll have the charging infrastructure the ability to charge will improve the speed of charging and the range will both add better but right now this is for people for whom this is something very important to them about the planet and about living a different kind of Lifestyle 

we've already shown you how Tesla can updated software in your garage to bring you the most up-to-date technology available now the Moto less is more than ever before the latest update is software version 7.0 with extra order pilot autonomous driving assistance so it let's go for a drive or maybe I'll let it drive and say what's new so sitting in traffic as you usually would in any City around Australia and you notice on the dashboard that there's now a steering wheel as well as a cruise control icon change that the camera app he can pick up the lawn mockings on the road in front double tap the cruise control system and older steering SATA now you should keep your hands on the wheel at all times but sometimes the Novelties just too much so steel accelerate it'll break stop you in traffic but what it want do is watch for red lights and no at what she else pay you going to be responsible for those things you should be responsible for everything while you're driving the car because it's just like you're driving but it's doing some of the hard work for you so accelerating away a speed limit is 70 on set on 67 for cruise control Soulja stop that but play cruise control or at $0.70 limit now letting the car do the steering for me it's monitoring those Lane markings using fences all around the car to make sure that it doesn't get close to other cars in traffic it really is remarkable sorry that you haven't went back in the card was garage and we go he almost autonomously we can't wait to see what version 7.1 of tizzle software brings with it stay tuned for that 



you sure so much about Tesla but how do you actually go about buying one I'm here at the Short Hills mall in Jersey and I'm going to go into a Tesla store and check it out let's go Hi how are you Short Hills Mall featuring are all electric sedan the model S and everything that goes along with it zero profile door handles so handle play what I'm noticing is so intuitive this is the largest on the market today to the World Wide Web you have access at your fingertips spell camera on the back and that automatically comes on when you put the car in Reverse this car has parking sensors as well as many other Radars and cameras that will help you you can control how the car steers how the car brakes got five different seat controls as well as a heated steering wheel I went to charge the car a lot but we've conveniently made it such that you can charge your car in universally any Outlet in the world or one of our many super stations that we've placed around the country I'm not 250 right now and you can see by these red icons these are all the places that you can charge what's up we've actually hit in the charge port and when it turns green is charging how do you actually buy a Tesla you can customize your own car in store and those typically take four to eight weeks to deliver if you're in a rush you can either purchase a Serta premium car or buy display model from a Tesla store if you're not too picky about specifications you can have a Tesla in your driveway the evening of your purchase also offers credit help on say because let's face it the cars do not come cheap the model S starts at about $75,000 before incentives and can easily shoot into the hundred thousands with customization you required to put $2,500 down in the store or $5,000 if you plan on leasing overall the purchasing process isn't too different from your run-of-the-mill dealership how's my favorite part the test drive such a good feeling the Yahoo Finance on Melody ha 

Kawaii Land beautiful beaches tropical Delights and stunning Sunset but back to the sun Hawaii gets a lot of on the island of kawaii they have found a way to use solar power at night this is the first combined battery and photovoltaic system in the world this project creates enough energy during the daytime to power up 2:45 houses on quiet night solar power is not new but storing this much energy from the Sun is the project Commission Hawaii Island utility Cooperative is owned by Tesla on about 50 acres of former sugarcane farm land some fifty five panels now stand soaking up the sun's power during the day to store in these Tesla batteries before feeding that energy to the entire Island during peak hours in the evening everyday these batteries will store enough power that they could drive a Tesla car hundred fifty thousand miles one obvious benefit less Reliance on fossil fuels the price of gas and oil can fluctuate but the cost of this system will remain stable for term of utilities 20-year contract with Tesla is expensive to get fossil fuel here Ajax this project alone all displace about 1.3 million gallons of diesel I think this is a reliability no additional car and the battery is that enough to power the island on its own all the time we still need to run just Lord I'm all in fact he is charging toward complete renewable energy by 2045 about 42% of energy sources are currently renewable are Target's to be at 70% by 2030 so we're actively looking to do more of these projects here is Art Tesla's only Green Solution on the solar farm the company also employs some rather unique renewable resources the grass is growing here between solar panels and under it it can get to be about ten feet tall but Tesla has come up with a very Eco way to handle it sheep they plan to bring in cheap like these you've done another Kawaii solar farm to Gray's keeping the grass nice and low so as long as the Sun keeps shining Kawaii will keep putting one of Hawaii's best adds to work
