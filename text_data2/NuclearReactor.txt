but the problem i find you get power stations this issue this dialogue and makes them a little confusing honestly the oldest boils down to this you've got to sell thing you can react to a it's kind like to catch it the war does not heed to buy like visiting it's heated by nuclear fuel rods boy you wore that produces the new friend of that pipe and that the impact of the fed by a convention of one fifth to love himself half of his election the fifth and i've felt a half and half the night in nuclear power station different workbench the wall is how the war has two forms to have to see that i need to get into the reactor core itself and what i found this is the height of the u. k. reactor and not many people get us out here because when active or what this would be around three hundred degrees celsius the thing oppression to find halt while the gershon pushing these walls and cots of course around forty thousand pounds where it's only pages coming from to do that it's coming from down here for fifties and nuclear fuel resentments now if operational this small slice of the pact with a four hundred of these engine giving out vast amounts of energy in the fourteenth nights ago every one of these glad to choose would be packed with thousands of little pilots like this and how it's been a uranium oxide and you rang in vet a special twirls consistent pattern we can sniff when things break apart they tend to relieve the energy story was that was holding them together that doesn't matter whether that some or stretch blasted out and to limit come in split its stock fund and why and when it is getting smaller high energy elements flying off in opposite directions now when max and that they cheats actions as surroundings holding things up big difference is that my household uses of bindle that told us that came out of today's not news more particle called a new drug that when it hits the bags and abby rightly so they can get sold course in athens become unstable and let's go as well as releasing all my energy pupils it relates to what reward mutual they can then fly off into the surroundings call and more trouble thing is that's the only really enough to sustain any connection because you rang enough things don't old nick i'm i've easily new jones need to getting it just the right speed of an act this whole reactive needs one more thing just what the warmth of the eyes of it well pretty soon that is down there is little neutrals to us and let them much more likely brooms sold by cable you right you got to us causing them to become unstable and see what angie good morning charles keating was asked day that kind racist i know you've got a critical which is a good thing because then you're generating plant sufficient quickly to love our stage and that is if the moon whew  uh   if an thief up no      if man i have thought of money to live up to date of birth thank one   filthy and to end of the panel in his the whip if and you can what the and one of them over eighteen twenty thirty to costanza to remove fuel from the levels that fuel let's switch in by teaching nuclear power station during the years fuel so often spent fuel polish placed inside transportation costs and then transported to the comet will get close shoving the utmost attention is paid to the safety of the people and indeed also the impact on the surrounding environment that goal has taken a significant step forward and look to the commission the fukushima don ameche nuclear power station which will require a thirty to forty years to complete those costs which the viewers transported to his village into the spent fuel pool next the newly installed fuel handling machine have fully and if something assemblage one by one of the speed of approximately one centimeter the second and lives than into the cops it is possible that small pieces of debris have become trapped in the fuel and the rat definite we come back to work catholic watching and thumbing each day each via an underwater camera and a measuring instrument the fuel loading takes place on the watch or radiation shield them for the radiation dose around the work area does not increase the fuel handling machine is equipped with us and so which automatically stops the rushing in one of the normal weight is detected we will continue to look with full attention paid to shift it to osmond loaded with twenty two film assemblers his load with the crane that trailer on the ground and while structure of lowering the cost employers billable hours is capable of raising and lowering the cost is in only one walk them fall even in the um unlikely event that one of the was breaks cost will not fit the costs transported to another building and the fuel they found out the storm and calm and cool we have conducted this operation twelve hundred times previously devil have experience of them all the operators were fully productive and trained for this operation birdsong for participating in a splash program on using the fuel having machine of frame in addition we have received confirmation of the operation from mr lake baron an outside expert at of all of us who the regulatory commission official them from other international flood waters we will come of this operation safely managed in transfer of war one thousand five hundred thirty three two the summer's shovel the completion by the end of twenty forty and hunt i think we need seventy xenon think carefully orchestrated serious ethical problems at the now that it needs a nuclear power plant in this incredible things that the words of affection and and fun than to every feeling out there recently have a purpose it saved up for the poor is the reason the reaction that contains the fuel and nuclear reaction in olive oil it's nearly two hundred families that have with her speak to our heads the fuel families are taken out of work place in a few building they already completely jammed with frightful place to get back on the jury at school the revival of an we are ready to tell what i've got the feeling even main purpose that it's often the only one or diesel generators that it emergency power supply all the eternal owns five sons of the hand and where will they do this than eyeliner inspections that are chained yeah it's calibration chance to demean generator he in many cases and we are also take the opportunity of a ray of these whoa we feel more hollow hour while the unit for some ways it's me to make all of that happening as many as one hundred and leave the convening every detail of the hour it is like eating minds how insane think it's all one bouncing contractors and over can plots that control center to ensure safety and precise execution on or see the successes how well we are in hell safely they perform of this his the photo was relaunched has to move war one a month adventurers the things that wouldn't needs mercedes painters necessary with hundreds of surveillance that a teen health and safety observations and we get this out as a lion c. d. is unquestionably year from the for fear of a derivative of war are you feeling fine sustain an awfully slow so i'd that john that's always top of mind never financed night and it stays that through successive about it now going to and over to morris alive and violin itself needs to be adversely theory all on ah out what if at all the third year law what if my name and fame noble than i am seventeen years old and the nuclear fogelson us which may be all over double leave but i am omelet and i would like to make the case that nuclear fusion we'll be that point that the bridge the t. boone pickens talked about will get us to you so nuclear fusion of our energy future and the second point making the case that kids can really change the world so you may ask how to thank you may have the wolf how do you know what our energy future as well adults of fusion reactor when i was fourteen years old on that is the inside of my nuclear fusion reactor i started building this project when i was about twelve or thirteen years old i decided i wanna make a store now knows you're probably saying oh well there's no such thing as nuclear fusion minority nuclear power plants would fusion energy well it doesn't break even above them produce more energy out but i couldn't but it still does i'm pretty cool stuff and i assembled a slap in my garage and and now lives in the physics department and the universe nevada redoubt and its plans together gates here i'm which is just hydrogen with an extra neutron so this is the similar to the reaction the proton jane it's going on inside the fond and fleming together so larded that back hydrogen fuses together and in the process at the house and byproducts of my utilizes byproducts so i mean the spur he is here i won the intel international science and engineering fear i developed the detector there were places the current detectors and homeland security has for plunder sunbelt dollars idol the system makes ethan stupidity of the factors that are hundreds of thousands of dollars i don't miss yeltsin in mind and my drive and i've got developed a system the breeze medical license it is the roaring multi million dollar fussell these i've developed a device that on a very small scale can for dc biased and so that's my fusion reactor in the back row mayor that is me at the control panel of my fusion reactor oh by the way i make yellow taken my girl i'm so my nuclear program of those advances iranians so maybe i don't wanna admit to that this is me it's third in geneva switzerland which is the preeminent particle physics laboratory in the world and this is made with president obama filling him ma and homeland security reasons sloth so in about seven years of doing nuclear the search i started out with a dream jamaica star image or a store in my grimes and i'm not being the president and the law of the things that might be contains the world i think other kids didn't see it so big you very much if why if that if an eight and five up to get it up and if at and it the the up find with that it five of happening it all of it if fate of what for what and then the up with for pat if it up thank for it and if that if up and it would have what that at that a up and what but if one and one what but what if if and when up the pit a what the fuck and now what if and if it fact that huh what did you what it what it whiff what and what but and what what i've if the fed if if they've fahey all were earners and hang the good of a case what  this is the ball royal naval college in greenwich the wall coverage in just a sort of most americans and bust goddess most bridge knows that what's the problem not been told to but i'm going on what in effect a lot different when that happens the top of decades of the season many is the smallest watching royal navy training that's the one silver i don't know michael korda some centuries ago there was silence means brings it up until the mid nineties and while the world might be proud of sovereigns you to some please have need to relax its nuclear reactors thee country club and so wanted to be few overwhelmingly an incitement to run on you to react while you bill nuclear reactor in the basement on the seventeenth century building just miles from the site of one seriously writes him somewhere in this time what sort of what it's getting what you really fell was looking you clever at some many years in nineteen sixty three to the nineties at wind right it's called so when you play and we saw this area was specifically exempted on one side are crawling well those polled nobody knew about it really is what about racial security and secondly well despite what's new to react to be what's diary it was only a tiny reactor at used and he wants us enough to put out about what you like to facts on the amount of fuel and wood used right sleep study toward no one ever been pushing novel here but well the stolen invited to talk with our don't want what they are the items in the movie if all invited top of the fates of the unknowns much that more graveyard shift in power some are quite like this and to that of all comes out as the foes of the youngstown by the things you sent in time for much david bowie who to the off about referred to move much the process of creating electricity using nuclear power begins with the splitting of uranium adams in the reactor this process called vision produces heat in the boiling water reactor the waters surrounding the nuclear fuel is turn to reichling to steam in the reactor vessel this team is then transferred by heights to the turbines the state or by astride the electric generator to produce electricity after the energy from the steam is used to spend the turbines is drawn into a condenser word is cool and condensed back in the water and come back to the reactor to be boiled into steam again and i thought so i'd do a shot at but all flights and still trying to stop chernobyl's reactor for the scene of the total meltdown twenty five years ago exactly the crisis that scientists in japan have been battling to avoid the death to jurors should it was and remains the world's worst nuclear accident thousands of people were killed thousands more joint accounts are among them soldiers ordered to the front line of thinking nope thankful for the sentry on we would give an extremely rare access into the contaminated reactive real person you briefly and in special clue that fight most of her mind walnuts olives it irradiation the vessels was happening had passage of telling means levels on for over now except deepens like the concrete into the reactor of the most evil itself and this is the control room of

vivid it was bob what are what is wildly does reingold the best way to tackle climate change scientists the end of this thing achievements but what a closer towards the dream of limitless power the book al jazeera rifles the first explosion blew up the top part of reactor containment building but the fukushima number one nuclear power plants this footage inside the building was taken during a regular inspections the nuclear reactor is housed behind this row boss paul this is what a nuclear reactor looks like the uranium inside the fuel rod inside the reactor undergoes new your fish and the rods him if he'd generating energy usually water calls to maintain their temperature at two hundred seventy degrees celsius but if accruing fails the temperature could rise to over twelve hundred degrees this temperature is hot enough mel the fuel rods up for the earthquake hit them first safety system to prevent the meltdown was activated control rods rose into the reactor to stop the nuclear fission as planned the reactor stop cooperating but the fuel rods were still hot water should've been circulated to cool them down however this didn't happen because of a power outage are right after the quake fill the second safe says of turnoff the emergency diesel power to earth again spring roth who bought an hour later so the unexpected happened without warning the emergency generator stopped our realm is how high the tsunami possibly us why is ten meters it hour for experts think this is what caused the generator to fail now read third safety system started operating it converts esteem traveling to the pipes into water it cools the rods bought the water level with them on and the temperature continued to rise all three safety measures had failed and movement professor arguable moto of the japan atomic energy commission was involved in construction of the fukushima plants where he thinks the cooling water somehow leaped from the reactor is one of the cabinet their reactor school once was too early to luxembourg of the building tonight we thought we had taken not adequate precautions were two nominees and what happened was beyond our expectations but he too forcibly cooled reactor c. water had to be pumped into it and the containment vessel similar failures and a huge explosion also had another reactor the plant on monday once again nature has challenged man's best efforts and during indian point nuclear power plant in buchanan new york were immediately struck by the huge films that in case it's we actors we also can't but notice security you can't just roll wanted security here is really titusville got uniforms given our driver's license that satellite feed god for vehicles taking on old glory but inspected it now we're ready to hit on in the nuclear reactor is that is after to go the things and more security jack's finally we head to the containment almost reactor number three which is currently off line for refueling right now itself right now so than the one with join out it's a little so we'll like walking onto a movie set but instead of passing would prompt we pass through a very slow all in all live in what the concrete and steel wall this is actually live and that does that all yellow tape warning of radioactive danger he's all let's separate cells from the white uniform technicians doing the refueled took place in the state fuel

we get worse when to nuclear reactor will they even vamp flip a mess what is the goal of them made a fool of the hive right up by as precise as the untoward refueling operations or the unknown not all the indian points reactor number two is only since nineteen ninety three but officials say releases as much as eight gallons of contaminated water would they need to run refuel and it happened and and so is this what we have found is that what they live in melville law efforts continue to pinpoint only what till pollock vp of operation says he does not pose a safety hazard since it's within the reactor core would just come out of the spent fuel pulls an hour have to be set for any radiation abilities and then that's reassuring but exec not debt would be causing the employee does look it just about twenty five miles outside new york city and new to fault lines there are concerns what's happened in japan to think this the possibility that it never happened in that the first one person the odds are that are here anywhere near a magnitude we plan what we think is possible happened in which the when for amateur on c. n. n. you can in new york it's a familiar sight in central new york the plume of water vapor rising from the five hundred forty three foot cooling tower and nine mile point the station with you people the chance to look inside the plane on the shore of lake ontario you too strict rules and tight security required by the presence nuclear fuel plan operations are hid behind concrete walls five feet thick white asses our and now i'm out to the larger of the stations to reactors shut down recently to load new uranium fuel to refueling must be done every to you and to sustain the nuclear reaction it keeps the plan the average fifteen hundred extra workers to fly to refuel and i mean it can only be done of plants off the homage also provide a rare opportunity to see inside strange looking all workers pass too tight security in radiation monitor on their way into the point that in workers also where doesn't it to record exposure to radiation depending on how had radiation is really working to pay to like devices might be monitored continuously to technician in another part of the plan valid reason love what we will have that and a control room for radiation technician watches those workers on camera school who are addressed head to toe in protective suits inbreeding filtered air the workers do maintenance and big valve in the dry while the concrete structure that surrounds the but if one of the dissenters on those employees who reaches the percent of

the reactors were moved by it overhead fling a massive pieces of pizza is the skids workers access to the real twenty one foot wide head of the reactor is on hold set aside some workers here inside the reactor is running nuclear reaction weeks he was more and stay in at whoa to insert between nuclear fuel it's out and reactor vessels fled into the top to furnish you didn't ring in the oldest of the fourteen foot long fuel to the inside to react to the inside for six years lifted out and moved on to all of a new roof and the spent fuel they will remain for another six years of soap then new fuel banos are moved into reactive us it's an intricate it's designed the company engineers to produce the hochmuth performance of the reactor fuel more than one million homes what do you the people in size of pushing on daiichi have learned some other challenges may be more difficult than they thought they looking into unresolved problems at the nuclear plant what the file on had seized on the standing of what's happening inside two years ago members of the government families their final report on the accident itself for many of these non emergency cooling system for me after three early on march thirteenth two days after the disaster but the latest findings from tokyo but how our company to let the cooling system had already stopped functioning and more than six hours before the findings suggest that fuel rods started melting earlier than ten officials believed and more melted feel wouldn't talk to the bottom of the containment vessel that makes the removal of the fuel more difficult than expected that go fish also also found more problems after the accident close use fire engines to inject water into reacted to that the water may have reacted with a few when scientists to put you hydrogen raising the temperature is significantly and that sped up the meltdown in thank if i warning high voltage is deadly radiation can be to the nuclear fusion is three sweep the sun as it was ridiculous amount to grab the bull fusion still some around or even close because we don't use the lads universities to have some awesome wants many types of ours refuses to primitive simplest
