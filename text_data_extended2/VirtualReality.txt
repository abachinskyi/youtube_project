hi my name is Eric and on the techy agent and this is Google cardboard sword of so for those of you who are unfamiliar with what Google cardboard is its Google's way of letting smartphone users experience VR or virtual reality on the cheap now course Google provides on their website instructions how you can your own Google cardboard without having to purchase one but the easiest way is of course just to buy one and have it delivered to your front door and not all of these are as cheap as you might think that's where the my 3D VR viewer which is basically Google cardboard comes in sold on Amazon for under $10 now even though this is Google cardboard alternative it is essentially Google cardboard in every way shape and form providing all of the same functionality as Google cardboard I mean let's be real it's not that hard manufacture engineer and imitate something that's made out of cardboard so Google cardboard is essentially made up of four main components the cardboard shell the washer on the side the VR glass viewers and then a rubber band on the bottom of it which helps hold your phone in place so it doesn't slide out when you're using it I won't have access to your touch screen while you're using the Google cardboard it has a magnet and a washer on the side that access is selector button while you're using apps games now one of the limitations of Google cardboard is that it's obviously designed for Android phones so on iOS on my iPhone I was only able to find a handful apps that work with Google cardboard but they worked well and they were a lot of fun to play around with so here I have a screenshot of what you would see if you were using the app without the viewfinder on so you'll see that it's split to a left and a right eye and then these are offset slightly too wide that 3D illusion and it uses your phone's accelerometer and gyroscope to help provide movement as you look around with your phone on screen it's pretty simple you put your phone in the case and velcro it shut and that's about it you're ready to go now the screen is at a precise distance from the lenses on the viewer so if you have a case on your phone that will throw off that viewing distance and make your image blurry so we found that we had better results when we took the case off our phones now in addition to the 3D apps that you can download there are also we found 3D videos on YouTube that you can watch and provide just kind of a neat illusion as you watch this three-dimensional video now for 10 bucks this is a really neat toy because it really was suitable for all ages both kids and adults alike have a lot of fun trying this out for the first time so this is a real Gateway for you to be able to dive into the world of virtual reality without breaking the bank on something like the Oculus Rift or Samsung's new VR headset couple of point for those of you who are interested in purchasing this and I'll provide a link in the description below I would recommend using a 5-inch screen something like the Nexus 5 and using without a case that will provide the best viewing angles and if you have an Android phone at your disposal use that instead of an iPhone because there are a lot more apps that cater to Google cardboard over the iPhone that's about it if you want some cheap entertainment for ten bucks to last you for a few days and you want to explore VR definitely check out my 3D viewer hey guys my name is Eric and I'm the agent don't forget to hit thumbs up to like this video and hit that subscribe button so you can be part of all of

the company called Oculus Rift which makes virtual reality headsets and I think we have one here they're planning ship the consumer model next year but they sent us a what type and it's not I mean it's a little bit clunky it's not totally ready but I thought I'd just give you a sample of how virtual reality Facebook works oh okay turn it up look at that it's amazing it feels like I'm in Facebook right now yes turn OC hey Dave good to see you oh no I haven't always cute he's very cute yeah that's great David that's a lot of pictures of hey is there something I can order to steal our jobs uncle Ron what do it listen up listen to me I need carrots for my Farmville please tell me a joke I don't like it I don't like it I don't like the 3D experience I'm not ready for Facebook in 3D are you attention all okay alright Jimmy Kimmel thanks for watching if you'd like to see more click below to subscribe to our YouTube channel and if not do nothing at all hey guys this is Austin is virtual reality the future of racing 5 friends over Castrol Edge invited me to check out their latest project pull off a race between two drivers wearing Reality helmets driving real cars one week until the virtual racer shoot so let's see if this thing is actually going to work you guys will probably remember Adam and Glen from the personal Castrol Edge virtual drift shooter Lee this year these guys are crazy enough to take everything up a notch This Time by making an actual race in virtual reality and around mid August are we got a phone call saying hey do you guys want to do another version we just like and they were like take a look at the tag they put together though and you'll see these guys are legit build a custom camera rig that use a pair of high-speed cameras a 3D camera for depth tracking are the position GPS tracker to feed info about where the car is back to the computer where is wine without some insanely and Vance heavier than is a nightmare turn a bunch of like thrown together Hardware into a tracking solution in less than two weeks until the world's coolest game controller world and track for the first to see inside the Oculus DK2 headsets it all works off a laptop the pulls data straight out of the car like wheel speed and throttle position that all comes together to make what should be one seriously awesome race fight so this is the racetrack they're going to be using for the shoot today so it's kind of more like an autocross sort of things you can see there's like these different cone where can we set up if this was a normal track and there's like normal drivers I mean obviously these guys are very talented there should be no problem but considering wearing a VR headset in the racing against each other tell me tough this is an actual world first to Nelly have a race in virtual reality but with actual cars on a track both drivers have Ford Mustangs that are powered by Castrol edge with titanium but otherwise their stock with the exception of the camera rig on the hood light are on top for tracking and a pair of laptops inside to handle all rendering a positioning plastic and respect cast for making this real and I had to give it a try here we go it's good man but a bunch of rocks oh yeah after trying it I'm convinced there's some serious uses for this kind of tech imagine turning any parking go to a race track without worrying about running off the road or into another car it might not replace racing anytime soon but they're really onto something with this I've got to give a huge shout-out to Castrol Edge inviting me out that sponsoring this video check out the full virtual Racers video over on their channel to see how it all came together backup Boo Boo Boo hey guys this is Austin then here in Southern California to find out how real is VR Castrol Edge motor oil invited me out to the set of their latest project at disco military base or real driver will be racing a real card and a completely virtual world he's going to be using an Oculus Rift headset which will make him totally blind to the real world cool thing is this is a project it's not a commercial all of this Technic casserole I just designed it actually real it's all about Castrol Edge taking technology and driving to the limit to get an idea of what right when the car is going to be like I first got a chance to check out the tech behind at all so hear anything helmet with the Oculus Rift DK2 built-in so it's going to try the helmet itself look straight out of death but inside it's all about the Oculus I couldn't drive the car with the helmet on which I can't say it was a huge letdown but I could still try the experience seeded being able to see a virtual the interior of the car while actually being in the car with surprisingly cool putting the text out of this together are Adam and Glenn these guys went all out they both the solution to read the input play car like steering and throttle got the Arctic a position to track the car and even put together a monster i7 5960x and GTX 980 regs if it's in the back seat Jesse find out that it was your your gut you have to like chair the whole thing of the hey guys actually this doesn't work I'm glad you finally got it working Katana battle in the mouth with another car and then I took a right and then all the sudden the ground is like there's a huge clit and so I stopped in front of you falling away so I go in reverse and I do like the reverse 180 into a right-hand turn something and it. Feels really cool cuz you're like this just like just going around so it's the very end of the day and I finally get to drive inside the car with the Oculus helmet on so please just a little bit what do you mean so good who plays in so I just did the ride along and that is completely insane I said the passenger steam first of all like I wasn't driving so like I didn't have any control over where I was going then just be able to I just fly down and spend and stuff it's it's unbelievable call like I don't even know what to say right now that is one of the coolest experiences I've ever had wow video started with a question about how real is VR think about this for a minute you've got an Oculus Rift connected to a monster computer inside a 600 plus horsepower Roush Mustang that is was millimeter precision and all of the data is being fed into a game engine that's running in real time it would have been the easiest thing ever to just fake it to make a commercial Vince de Castro made the coolest first set up another experienced if a Pro driver can drift completely blind to the real world using VR I say the future is looking pretty bright deadly be sure to check out the full video on their Channel all came together pictures of the screen her name is Ethan today reality virtual reality reality can do these things are just made out of cardboard we just ordered them on what's on there like $10 you can make them yourself though all right here it is hang on I'll set it up for you look up at the start button you see the start button take a picture and I can see a train I think another roller coaster things look up where do you stand up what are you retry lookup Giants game download first game we played this roller coaster game so it looks like you're on a roller coaster so if you look at it if you got to look at the start button there then we go listen when you put in the goggles you can look around look up you'll see a big balloon up there big old blunt it doesn't goes upside down to a really feels like you're going upside down it looks around so if you look up so you look up look up to but then the key is when you put it in these things open S your phone right here at work what you got to do is turn it into goggle mode so when you press this it turns it into two little eyeballs I see something there's a thing right in the middle here you can download how do you fish with one eye to see the elephant over there and we need a strap and you look in this one if you look around there you can see is it going to feel like a rockstar you might have moved out that fantasy through a little video game called rock band but what if they could do the same virtual reality and make it feel more real than it ever has that's what harmonica music system which has made games like Guitar Hero Rock Band and dance central is trying to do what does err isn't just the normal rock band poured it into the Oculus Rift it's a total rethinking of the system and what it actually means to play rock band and live out fantasy of being a rockstar so we went to the harmonics offices in Boston to check it out for ourselves uses the same plastic guitars older versions of the game it's not the Rock and you remember for one thing you'll be adding an Oculus touch motion controller which brings that guitar into the game for another you'll be playing with a completely different system this classic rock band formula when the song starts individual note start rolling down what's called a note highway to a song you have to hit the right buttons on your guitar at the right time unfortunately it doesn't work in virtual reality on a normal TV you don't really care about what's behind or around the no Highway you're pretty much just staring in a box in your living room the headset the point is that you feel like you're on a stage with your bandmates as it stands you're spending the whole time staring at that line whether it's floating in the crowd or coming out of the end of your guitar the harmonics came up with turns a game about notes into a game about cords instead of a highway you can see the structure of the whole song with dots that represent different chords when one is coming up your guitars headstock starts flashing the pattern you need to play you'll get points for hitting it on the beat and well that's it if you're doing the bare minimum the rest of the song you can play whatever you want or you can stop playing all together and teleport around the stage for casual players the game is more about having the Rockstar experience than nailing guitar riffs the BF is it going to start doing and whatever you play it'll sound alright the game also gives you specific optional challenges to me being high level player means finding good rhythms for each song staying on feet what's the mixing up your cords and patterns or at least that's what her monnex tells us I didn't have time to go deep into the system one of the great things about non rock band is that it's such a social approachable experience only has one instrument you got damage inside the game but the rift separates you completely from The Real World if you get embarrassed by other people watching you rock out rock band VR will at least let you of seeing them but if you like putting on impromptu concerts with your friends it's a little isolating and even if you're totally alone nothing able to see your own fingers as weird which are Generations Harmonix wants to put the band back into rock band but it'll be a different kind of social experience instead of making you round up for headsets to play locally the game away team up with people around the world if everything goes right you'll feel as close to them as you would with your friends in real life but there's still something intimate about playing with people in the NVR hasn't captured it yet rock band VR as a launch title for the Oculus touch controllers and it's one of the most exciting games I've seen for the rift not because it's the most polished one what does the underlying formula is so solid but we still haven't been able to answer one big question how much of a game will it be being a rockstar in VR is fun for a while but without a challenge or with a challenge that's too confusing to meet it's hard to imagine coming back to it over and over and that's the kind of thing you can't figure out in a few so are we fans right now definitely will we still be fans in October when the full game comes out that we're still waiting to decide Katy Perry how about your FICO Chesapeake Virginia JCPenney headquarters hydrometer Neymar's dad dad dad no no phone for Idaho go go go go go go Thunder go to Galaxy 4 go to go to go to go to go to go to college where is VPK
