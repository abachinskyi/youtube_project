Daddy's Gone like something you see on Good Day Sunshine the best wisdom new release movies play games TV repair DJI go gems Easter Seals Bay area Craigslist CVS an unlikely group of companies are teaming up in the medical field IBM Apple Johnson & Johnson and medical list maker Medtronic are partnering to form a Watson Health Data Ventures joining us now to discuss this is Dan Kosta he's editor-in-chief of pcmag.com this is interesting here IBM we are dino there about Big Data rights looking to transform the medical industry by making sense of all of the merging of this flood of day that going all play back to the 1970s tell us about how the company's planning to do all of this and use that Watson technology on the consumer level you've got the Apple healthkit which is through the front lines collecting the data about users this could be we're all used to seeing rrr tivity tracking on on locations could be much more than that can be diet it could be wait so that's how the date is being collected you go one level up and you see Apple's research kit which allows researchers to conduct experiments commands to create apps to collect even more research and collect small experiments IBM Watson is going to be doing sort of an even higher level cloud-based analysis are you take all of this data continue mind it for insights and it's really pretty excited alright so that's right now but Apple's got Pacific role in this to what what what role are they going to play in this Venture at the front line as a collection of what which is really what it is we've never had a population that's been as wired and connected as it is right now there's all sorts of feedback that can be connected everything from like I said they itiviti track that's where it is now but when you look down the line you say OK what else could you do with this technology are they've got a research project now that's tracking asthma rates with local air quality and home for the matches and seeing if their correlations that's something that's never really been able to be done before in real time and its scale this is a competitive space a lot of players in this business here that means a lot of people do it to it to gather all this data for medical records and what not do you think it's going to be a start up an existing IT company or or ybm itself it's going to revolutionize this Medical Data Business I mean with apple Medtronic Johnson Johnson's Partners does IBM actually have a leg up in this in the infancy stage of medical cloud computing and health cloud computing we're going to see Innovations individual companies are going to have Innovative products and Innovative services on sort of a micro scale it's a great thing we're IBM's really got an advantage is it it's been doing integration large-scale integration with Legacy systems for years and you know a lot of the medical industry somebody's medical records go back to the seventies getting that data out of those databases and into modern platforms that can be used to something IBM does really well so I think they've really found us spot here they're great and integration it's a great story and it's only because we all know that healthcare costs are not shrinking they're going to keep rising and rising and rising in the future Dan you so much you don't as a stand cost at he's ended her and chief of pcmag.com and thanks for watching Tech that I'm Dominic too have a great day Brandon Dowdy from CNBC thank you so much for checking on our Channel you can subscribe by clicking right here to check out the latest Mad Money CEO interviews market news Financial west end product unboxing enjoy artificial intelligence comes in many forms these days like Siri on your phone for Cortana for you Android users or just in a simple search engine even evil ones like this Terminator but most people don't really know where it all came from how artificial intelligence even became intelligent well I'm here today to Enlighten you on this subject essentially intelligence is by definition the capability of machine to imitate an intelligent human behavior software does the simulated neurons that are all connected test it just like a human brain and they're on strengthen those connections over time and you say I can also be used for object recognition like in this clip research run a software here that can be used on a laptop to detect objects in real-time and display them as you see here software what are this is being used in this little guy to alarm to communicate with people in all different languages robots like this are already being used in Japan as bank tellers for form custom stork lyrics to do simple tasks they are but a small step in the realm of possibility with artificial intelligence stepping back into the past of a ears just a deep blue a chess-playing supercomputer developed by IBM that stunned the world in 1997 when it beat the Russian World Champion grand mass chess player Garry Kasparov on May 11th in a series of six games title of man versus machine it's victory became a feat of technological genius the ship world and its greatness what really decides she doesn't telogen or not or if I can even think well back in the early 1950s a test of sorts was developed by Alan Turing mathematician and scientists the study of machines and simple computers the Turing test as it is called goes like this volunteer perhaps goes into a room with a machine they proceeded to have a normal conversation with each other this goes on for a while then afterwards the aid ask the volunteer if they could tell if they were talking to a person or a computer if they say they were talking to a person passes if not it's fails I hope this video and everything in compass within it will help you understand the AI is still in its early developing stages and that in the coming years artificial intelligence play a huge role in a new technological era thank you artificial intelligence intelligence exhibited by an unnatural identity the branch of computer science dealing with the reproduction of human-level intelligence self-awareness conscience thought in computer programs essential quality of a machine which thinks in a manner similar to her on the same general is a real human being artificial intelligence synonyms Sicilian telligen CP artificial intelligence in one of my machine learning grew out of artificial intelligence artificial intelligence was about creating machines that were themselves as smart as humans and along the way to feel Divergent a difference the thought including cognitive systems which is focused on thinking like humans and machine learning which is focused on creating machines that act autonomously in general regardless of whether or not they're thinking like humans set a start a conversation about machine learning let's talk a little bit about artificial intelligence in general and where machine learning fits in to do this we're going to borrow from one of the classes at Georgia Tech knowledge-based artificial intelligence it's not by show coil and I and it is here but see recovered very early in the course if you're interested you can find the length of the full course in the instructors notes below what were Riis all the companies across the world it's understanding what their customers want a great example is Kodak to see that their customers were interested in digital cameras this led to limiting stock prices and filing a bankruptcy but how can I go do you know what its customers want the simple answer is data such as data gathered from customers voicing their opinion on social media customer queries online reviews call center knows CRM data and customer complaints but over 80% of this relevant information exists as unstructured data such as emails PDF files audio and video files but mostly what exists as text employing customer support personnel and regular analytics tools to analyze this huge amount of data has proved inefficient Softly As a solution for this problem which combines artificial intelligence text analytics and sentiment analysis part of the solution is in the form of SMS Bots the Bots asks free to find questions from users about items to be purchased using text analytics in natural language processing SMS bot establishes relationships among words and finds keywords to match the user input after analyzing conversations Bots response to the user with the appropriate price for the item for over using sentiment analysis the Bots can identify the emotional state of the effective feedback and resolving customer complaints want to know more visit our website or give us a call 202-233-2388 dresses alright small coffee

pickup Bill Gates the scared of superintelligent machines and he thinks you should be too okay so the word he used was concerned but still tree painted in his Reddit ask-me-anything session was ominous it best first the machines will do a lot of jobs for us and not be super intelligent a few decades after that though Elgin to strong enough to be a concern I agree with Elon Musk and some others on this and don't understand why some people aren't concerned gay throat Gates is referencing the fears of space CEO Elon Musk who has spoken out about the dangers of artificial intelligence on several occasions Ray's where is the guy with the pentagram and holy water and he's like yeah you sure you can control the demon then work out it will have a very bad effect something like getting rid of spam email or something inside concludes will the best way to get a response to get rid of humans share their position sing who has made similar warnings breathing rate human biological evolution compete talk especially from those kinds of figures hasn't gone unnoticed but as Gary Marcus writes for the New York or despite attracting the attention of a number of media Outlets most people see

the future will be those jobs that cannot be done by artificial intelligence and robots and there are huge gaps in with a robot robots a very bad eyesight they see lines Oracle squares but they don't understand that these lines are those squares make up a face or a chair or a cup pad recognition is one of the big problems common sense you don't understand the simplest things about human behavior about the world can pull the strings can I flush so the two jobs that will thrive in the future and the two sets of jobs that will be destroyed or his files on Blue Collar jobs repetitive jobs are going to be wiped out obliterated this means jobs in the automobile industry textile industry that are purely repetitive are in danger good jobs in Blue Collar work will Thrive garbageman sanitation people gardeners police construction workers every job is they will survive it defies Common Sense the people who'll be thrown out of work are middlemen Lola accountants bookkeepers agents tellers middlemen the friction of capitalism are going to be obliterated so who will benefit among white collar workers workers who engage in intellectual capitalism what is intellectual capitalism it involves common sense in other words creativity imagination leadership analysis telling a joke writing a script right doing science realize that England said funny Blair the rise more revenue from rock music rock music then it does the industry because we're making the transition from a commodity base capital a call to intellectual Capital like rock and roll the era of artificial intelligence is here referred to as the fourth Industrial Revolution advances in artificial intelligence machine learning robotics nanotechnology 3D printing and biotechnology are disrupting business and labor markets around the world with enormous change predicted in this sets needed to thrive in the new landscape in this micro Master Series on artificial intelligence you will learn from experts in their field who teach at Columbia diversity the series consists of four courses that serve as the foundation for your expertise and artificial intelligence and machine learning and two of its key applications Robotics and computer animation and the first course artificial intelligence doctor on softly but we see percent how to design intelligent agents or Bots that extract data online using certain criteria or keywords intelligent agents are often used as news retrieval services for online shopping and automated tasks dr. John Paisley teaches II course in the series machine learning machine learning is based on algorithm mathematical equations that telecommuter what functions do similar to following a recipe without algorithms your phone wouldn't work there would be no Facebook no Google no Amazon algorithm schedule lights and then fly the airplane they can even help doctors diagnose diseases robotics the third course in the series will give you an opportunity to learn the core what makes for representing robots that perform real tasks in the real world dr. McCarley will cover the fundamentals of Robotics focusing on them in the body spending on robots worldwide is expected to jump from just over 15 billion in 2010 to about 67 billion are 2025 the cost of high-quality robots and components is dropping rapidly while CPUs are getting faster and application programming is getting easier about to become cheaper smaller and more energy-efficient they gain flexibility in finesse increasing their potential applications dr. 810 greensman the world expert when it comes can make a computers deal with complex Graphics like hair will teach you about computer animation and CGI and this course he will examine the basic rules of motion turn them into computer programs exactly how studios are animating and Hollywood movies and creating new tools for graphic designers we have a lot to learn what started this is our future at a time when men has the independent on robots to satisfy every need mom made us better at what we do than was ever humanly possible science will create a new order of artificial being a machine possible more Allegiant more feeling and More Human Than ourselves until you were born robots didn't train robot student desire and what we told him some of us would embrace it they made us too smart too quick and too many that's why they hate us are you from people stay away from all people of the others like you are statements what degree do you have to do to watch the Moon are you afraid of sing songs I can show you how to reach them the USC Center for AI Society is a joint collaboration between the viterbi School of Engineering and the shoes and where School of Social Work featuring contributions of Faculty from both schools is overarching goal is the use of artificial intelligence to Saul society's problems past few decades that being significant advances in artificial intelligence but not many applications of this work for social problems such as with the law resource come how does a sociologist an experimental social psychology and I finished that degree up and I was like so Professor Eric Rice and I are collecting this new center for artificial intelligence in society we bring together understanding problems and Community engagement from social work and tools and techniques from AI are working closely with the tell me if engineering and our own dean of engineering at USC big glob of challenges the National Academy of engineering is articulated 14 Grand challenges secure the cyberspace advance Health informatics engineer better medicines reverse engineering the brain improve and protect the infrastructure access to clean water can you believe Grand challenges are one important way to reinvent a profession to engage new people and actually to attack find the minimum social problems so Professor Edison I have been collaborating for spreading information about HIV among home there's a real sense of optimism we've already run pilots in LA and now we received the ground to continue this work for 900 homeless youth another ground Char in the bike for a similar types of work using AI for wildlife conservation public transportation climate change and natural disasters and their impact on law resource communities excitement of ideas that I want to be a part of his my life but then I also feel like I need to find a place where that has an impact in the world and social we provide this perfect intersection right where you get to be thinking about ideas and creative ways engineering is going very fast Endocrinology moves forward is disruptively and this reception usually is kind of an aha moment it's it's a great day to depart you cannot do this less you are creative so the talent is there at USC everybody benefits from a spirit of respect for other human beings and so many areas that are faculty of interested in next 4 days and you want to bring them all together in the center so the past decade we've been applying for Public Safety and Security for wildlife conservation Adventist exciting collaboration an important collaboration with Professor Eric Rice it seemed the time is right now to establish this USC Center for artificial listen to society so that it becomes in fact leader in this very important space what did you know about artificial intelligence and Watson before IBM suggested it might make a contribution in medical not much actually I had watched it play Jeopardy I knew about that and I was very I was like oh this is what we need the jeopardy playing computer that's going to solve everything so what did your skepticism cancer stuff business there is lot of false prophets and false promises it's not I'm skeptical of certain home if they need new idea and cancer I just didn't really understand what it would do what Watson's AI technology could do is a simply with dr. sharpless and his team of experts do every week at this molecular tumor board meeting they come up with possible treatment options for cancer patients who already failed standard therapies they try to do that by sorting through all of the is medical journals in trial data but it is nearly impossible to keep up I don't think it's a trial open yet to be on top of everything that's out there all the trials are taking place around morale seems like an incredible task for anyone University when one facility to do it's essentially undoable one and understand we have dowsing new research papers published every day you know no one has time to read 8000 papers a day so we found that we were deciding on therapy based on information that was always some cases 12-24 months at a date however it is a task that Telemetry for Watson Watson to read medical literature essentially in about a week was not very hard and then lots of red 25 million papers in about another week and then it also scan the web before Michael trials open another senators and all the sudden we had this complete list that was sort of everything one needed to know that this blow your mind Play My Mind no hay isn't all bad because ever since that I'm not match this month between Korean projekt master Isa Dolan Google deepmind computer Adam alphago public interest has grown a great deal in artificial intelligence here in Korea the menu wondering if these programs could have been she take over are jobs from humans kimokeo reports continuous development technology worldwide has plans to boost South Korea's artificial intelligence industry people have been questioning up to what extent could take over if these robots could replace humans which shops would be at high risk Bikram Plymouth information service and Vale the list of jobs in Korea that could be replaced by AI in the next 5 years included jobs that involve repetitive tasks or those that require less communication among some 400 jobs concrete workers top the list followed by plastic and rubber producers security guards and tax administrators and that order delivery men gas station workers and babysitters will also play the top 30 jobs that could be at risk among professional jobs Underwriters general practitioners and air traffic controllers had relatively higher risks on the other hand I'll keep patients that require human emotions especially in the Arts and Music sector had lower possibilities of getting replaced Otis and sculptors release replaceable Fall by photographers music composers musicians and belly dancers actors designers and teaching professionals also had low possibility replacement employment information service at that it base its research on a Model created by Oxford University's Frey & Osborne in 2013 I think this could be a good opportunity to cooperate with these robots and improve overall outcome by allowing them to take over the simple and repetitive it make humans focus on more valuable work in our society before 2020 chemokine use
