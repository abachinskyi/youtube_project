now now tired of struggling with your data what if your machine could learn how to handle data on its own without being told exactly what to it's cold machine learning if the signs of getting computers to help being explicitly program is supervised learning teacher gives the machine examples of inputs and the desired output with a goal of learning at general rules and not these inputs and outputs customers touch points if your business using supervised machine learning we can automatically categorize them and happy neutral and angry customers sinking categorize customers he could also react offer discounts or new deals for angry customers there's also machine learning roll your point structure in its input unsupervised learning to be a gold in itself for a mean swords and analyze customers education geographic location and the list goes on however one dimension does not explain why customers are happy or angry unsupervised morning looks at multiple dimensions of customers and grooving to a certain category of people who behave in a similar way this might find a group of angry people who want their product or don't like the name or want pickles on their burger or a spicy stuff this is how machine analyze customer behavior and customize a product down to an individual level like ice cream by cheeseburger the algorithm underneath changes itself based on its own work as machine learning becomes more prevalent will be teaching with larger and larger multi structured data terabytes and petabytes that's why you need teradata Aster machines a faster smarter engine of processes data Aster has storage that can handle row column and file storage why did such as email text while web logs and since you data and you don't need to worry about whether your data is structured or unstructured the teradata aster is Bill to optimize all the processes coming into the engine finally provides more than 100 pre-built algorithm so you don't need to worry about loading these complex machine learning algorithms in different languages you can Wrangle control of your data you could be a date of Rockstar Ninja you can come the cheetah Whisperer are so start machine learning in teradata Aster today slammed this is a fifth of a series of short videos discussing Big Data they're designed for those looking for high-level view of this face my name is Cathy Chung and today I will wrap up our discussions about Big Data Technologies as mentioned before Big Data Technologies today off and refer to Hadoop no SQL real-time and machine learning let's focus on machine learning for the next couple of minutes machine learning artificial intelligence is about the construction and study of cysts I can learn from data for example machine Learning System could be trained on email to learn to distinguish between spam and non spam messages after learning when do you use to classify new messages into spam and non Spam folders the core of machine learning deals with representation and generalization representation of data princess and functions evaluated on these instances are part of all machine Learning Systems generalization is a property that the system will perform well on unseen data in census there are two types of machine learning supervised learning and unsupervised learning supervised learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from label training the training day that consists a set of training examples in supervised learning each example is a pair consisting of an input object and a desired output the parallel task in human and animal psychology is often referred to as concept learning a couple examples of supervised learning algorithms works and decision trees unsupervised learning are labeled there's no error or reward signal to evaluate a potential solution unsupervised learning techniques and explain features of the data examples of unsupervised learning are data clustering and self organizing map there's a whole list of supervised learning algorithms unsupervised machine learning data mining focuses on the discovery of previously unknown properties on the data the two areas overlap as data mining using machine learning methods employee state of mining methods unsupervised learning or as a pre-processing steps to improve accuracy machine learning this may refer to Machinery on Big Data with mapreduce which is adaptation and execution of machine learning algorithms in the mapreduce framework with lots of data he gets better and the models get more accurate thank you for listening and join me next time to examine some big data companies what's up we got a whole bunch of trees we have to look at Michael and we're going to have to have come up with some clever way to look through them and this gets his back to something we talked about before which is an turn the bias and in particular the notion of inductive bias story about when we think about algorithms that are searching through space one is what's called a restriction bias the other is called preference by restriction biases nothing more than the hypothesis set that you actually care about so in this case with decision trees I apoptosis is all possible decision trees that means we're not considering Weigel's 2x +3 when are considering quadratic equations were not considering non Boolean functions of a certain type only considering decision trees and all that they can represent and nothing else okay so that's important because instead of looking at the infinite number uncountably infinite number of functions that are out there that we might consider we're only going to consider those that can be represented by a tree over in all the cases we given so far discrete variables but a preference bias is something that's just as important and it tells us what sort of hypotheses from this hypothesis that we prefer and that is really at the heart conducted bias what would you say is the inductive bias ID3 algorithm that is given a whole bunch of decision trees which decision trees with ID3 prefer over others no it definitely try speak since it since making his decisions top down it's going to be more likely to produce a tree that has good splits near the top then the tree that has bad spots of the top even if the two trees can represent the same function so good splits near the top right and you said something very important there Michael given to decision trees that are both correct they both represent the function that we might care about it would prefer the one that had the better Split near the top so any other preferences any other inducted bias on the ID3 group prefers one that model the data better to one's the model need a worse right so this is one forget it prefers correct ones to incorrect ones so given a tree that has very good what's at the top but produces the wrong answer it will not take that one over one that doesn't have his good splits at the top but does give you the correct answer for ID3 although when you put those two together in particular we look at the first one there's sort of a third one that comes out as well which is ID3 our intense to prefer order trees to longer trees now that comes naturally from the fact that you're doing good splits at the top cuz you're going to take trees that actually separate the day too well by labels you're going to tend to come to the answer faster than you would if you didn't do that so if you go back to the example that we went before you're one of the attributes doesn't split the data at all that is not something that I do 3 would go for and it would in fact create a longer and unnecessarily longer tree number for shorter trees over longer trees so long as they're correct and they give you could split near the top of the tree over a billion people are estimated to live in poverty around the world that's a plain people living on less than $2 a day poverty reduction is one goal that almost everyone can agree on last year's United Nations sustain development goals set 169 separate development targets to be met by the year 2030 with poverty reduction has a principal goal how do we actually track progress towards these goals right now are Ambitions exceed our capabilities most countries don't collect much data and turn up traditional household survey based data collection efforts will be expensive what if less conventional data sources could help shed light on these the dough comes that's what our project does we combine high resolution satellite imagery with powerful machine learning algorithms to predict how rich or poor specific locations around the world are but standard machine learning approaches to interpreting imagery work best when they have lots of data think get to the labeled images unfortunately there are few places in the world where we can tell the computer with certainty whether the people living there are rich or poor Your solution is to combine high-resolution daytime imagery with images of the Earth at night places that are brighter at night are usually developed use this night light data to help us find features in the higher resolution daytime imagery that are correlated with economic development roping told what to look for our machine learning algorithm learns to pick out many things that are easily recognizable such as roads urban areas water is Farmland these features summarize the huge amount of information in each satellite image the final step is to use these features predict village-level wealth as measured in surveys we do this in five African countries Uganda Tanzania Nigeria Malawi go to Wanda we find that our method does a good job protecting the distribution of poverty in fact a better job than any existing Pros that we stop since it's cheap and scalable requiring po me satellite images it could be used to map poverty around the world helping Aid organizations to distribute funds more efficiently and policymakers to an act and evaluate policies more effectively the difference between machine learning artificial intelligence artificial intelligence is really out a larger entity that actually utilizes the outcome of machine learning machine learning to me really is taking the big day to this is labret ring your big data and using that to make these models that have an output that can then be consumed in utilize by out of visual intelligence so example machine learning would be find users in the demographic groups I would be predicting the prices on certain inventory a real estate prices and that would have you and I to me would be more of the you have your optimizing and you're running through and that technique of controlling your pace and your felons 04 in conjunction with the predictions coming from learning would be to me more of an AI kind of thing is more taking a lot of knowledge and assembling them into something that's dues to decision and do something on the Fly whereas machine to me is classifying or predicting something that is utilize Downstream so it's an important tool under the hood but typically I would say that is not used on shouted really is a congestion information compression to then you'll something that's usable to to an AI or ay and authorization yeah I would like to think that there's some situation that you chew where it would be mostly automated I I've been in this industry long enough for any industry in and that use it Isis the machine learning to say that ideally always kinda wanna man in a loop for various reasons but in general most things and go pretty smoothly so we would call A set-it-and-forget-it kind of approach by predictions for where this all is going is really yeah we're trying to unify the industry's trying to unify screen so that eventually media should be irrelevant to you it will be able to be played on your desktop your mobile your TV or whatever TV is morphing into which way content so much as where you play it 110 really ideally will be able to say distributor budget how you want it Target the right people one of my hopes for the future is that we move away from a model of of a and spending that budget to specifically being so good at targeting what you want that the world becomes optimize on the kpi optimizing those clickers Argo what is you want and if we go above and beyond that that Marge is eaten by us and there that would give us greater impetus to pursue what you want say the rest of the inventory for the world where it's actually valuable and just pursue things for the sake of spending a budget that's one big thing I think is out there I think bringing to Bear more and more information at auction time is show all that moves away from this notion of static segments where you had to have pre characterized users and say they're this demographic bucket or they have this interest to a represent should wear the user information that you cleaned up a time is is so strong and can be conveyed to the auction call and utilize their at you now can one-time decisions relative to everything new about a user everything you know about the media and everything you see in the specific ad called that time in order to facilitate doing play job they are so reach no longer becomes a question it's a matter of just how many options do you see and how can we deliver that kpi most effectively so sudden forget it will be great but list things as well relative to how things could go would be fantastic and in Irina they also leverage everything we know about so this is an application of Predictive Analytics technologies that are navel by Machine learning in the industrial man factoring industry we have built a predictive model using the thing works analytics machine learning applications that can tell the variables that are associated with failure and actually predict up to a week before hand when these turbines are going to fail so what you can see here is that I'm actually monitoring vibration from one of these spinning turbines in real time and I can tell if these vibrations exceed an allowable threshold so I'm just going to shake this turbine for a moment so what you can see is that there is a spike in this vibration graph so now I know that when these vibrations are happening in specific area for a gearbox that's between 4 and 16 years old and when there is the presence of friction harmonics that risk percent Escalades from 41% to just under 89% and that's an incredibly powerful insight and I could probably never come up with that inside by using spreadsheets and traditional statistical analysis techniques it's the machine learning algorithms that thing works analytics provides this liberating these insights from the get a set and providing the providing them to me automatically in this thing works user interface and so anybody that has a vested interest in their ass maintaining uptime can better align with service professionals before the failure occurs go through a long lead part 4 next processes to the get the materials that they need they can do the replacement as quickly as possible when the failure does occur this is a game-changing application because his store play machine learning was only available to academics and Google data scientists now it's available to the masses and just about any product developer with or without technical skills can Leverage The Power of machine learning with thing works Analytics hi my name is Timo Elliott I'm an innovation evangelist with ASAP I'm here at Sapphire now with David Judge David tell me a little about yourself yes so I just very recently joined sap and I've joined as the cheat evangelist for pick of analytics first and now as you've seen the launch announcement for Leonardo will be working quite a bit on that as well cursive it about your background why what's your background and what brought you to sap why did you want to so I have about teen years now within machine learning cognitive Technologies I think we're playing buzzword bingo earlier today so my background has that littered throughout it and being an only a month into a CP I think I've been extremely impressed by never won the quality of the individuals through within the business and I got brought in by a former by a friend of mine so I had some clue about that but also the enormous opportunity that we have statistic was 350,000 businesses have that say p as a system of record which means if we start layering some of these disruptive Technologies on that digital core we've got miles to go and lots of customers to help just imagine customers watching us now they like okay what are the how to make a zillion times what's in it for me can you make it more real so I think one of the things to keep in mind about machine learning is it it's not something that you do on to it best to be applied to a business process it's a fruit sample if you can look at the way that a customer might interact with your business from the outside cognitive Technologies like chatbot when something has been quite common right now so that's one element of machine learning but then looking more around even structured data where we can convert special use cases of Predictive Analytics all those things coming together to close the front of the office being with the back of the office and make things happen a lot faster should be doing as part of your Innovation wrong I'll be working with customers Partners certainly a fair number of speaking engagements most likely and then helping to spread sort of the pragmatic vision of how Leonardo on might give to help customers as well now where most of the way through the first day what are your impressions been it's been pretty welcome aboard and thank your time okay Michael so I pulled up this webpage we will provide a link to it on our own web pages and you'll notice is a really nice copyright here and this is all radio so I'm not I'm not doing anything wrong here they're going to use independent analysis as a way of recovering original sounds so here you see that I've clicked on do a police car somebody talking in a commercial and let's say this dude here and what it's going to do is it's going to generate sounds each of three sources that are all independently generated and it's going to make some so if I click on these icons here are these microphones CDs with just like what I drew before you'll be able to hear each of their sounds combined together so I can put my microphone very close to it so you can hear it and another one of the microphones okay so Michael could you hear that yes okay so what I did is I play to the the the mix sounds together and not to the untrained ear they sound very much alike I think the most important thing is all three of these sounds are over on top of one another and as human beings we actually do a pretty good job of being able to focus on one of them cuz we're designed to do that but machines have historically had a terrible time of doing this an independent analysis was the first sort of generic algorithm it was able to solve this so can use ICA now to separate the sound sources and as you see we get these little gramophone things and I'm going to play each one of these and see if they did a good job separating house into the original sources the Guardians of the electronic stock market NASDAQ open burned by past ethics questions okay so was that kind of cool Michael I mean we we took these completely mixed up sounds that we were able to recover the original are using independen component analysis I don't understand what it's doing but it's pretty neat that it could do that because it sounded pretty mix to me what was in fact each one of these two resources that we eventually heard were in fact arbitrarily literally combined into each of these separate microphone and there's really sort of no way in which would be able to recover the original sound because there's no reason for you to be able to do that but people do it all the time and now it's unlike Opana component analysis you can also do it in the reason it works with independent analysis and that fundamental assumption that it's making is that whatever is generating in these cases he sounds are statistically independent of one another which happens to be true in that case and their combined together in a way that is a linear combination there's a lot of details here and again when you read the materials exactly how independent analysis works but intuitively all it's doing is taking this particular model and buy using Mutual information directly to find things that are independent of one another while not losing any information from the observables it's able to reconstruct the South how to do this incredibly quickly and Incredibly well under a large number of conditions synthetic intelligence and machine learning have fascinated movie answers for decades in the film's robots help us want to destroy us I would think us or simply want to live lives of their own but what exactly is machine there today in Short Machine learning is the process of a computer teaching itself how to carry out a task instead of following programming or instructions from humans does bed training data to help it establish patterns after making many adjustments to its model it should be able to act on its own finding answers are inside so that having been explicitly program towards the how does technology being used and who's using it companies such as Google Apple IBM amazon-web-services Microsoft and more are all working to establish themselves in the space the United Kingdom's National Health Service is coordinating with a Google owned company to train an artificial intelligence recognize two common eye diseases self-driving cars can provide greater safety to Road users and home assistance could provide care and companionship to those who are homebound well those examples are in development for the future some machine learning is impacting our daily lives right now drink Google rank brain which is used to provide more relevant results for search engine users or recommendations from shopping website the movie Services Bots can answer questions or even hold conversations they can also be used in manufacturing to streamline processes and optimize resources so what are some of the trends in machine learning the near future will largely be focused on nothing new algorithms in models and finding new areas to apply the technology to in terms of working with machine learning a recent study published by Evans data has shown that third of Big Data developers use some facet of it in their work using it are likely to be working on projects related to the manufacturing and finance Industries or developing internet it makes sense that they would be so many Big Data developers involved in order to make the most of machine learning and its applications a very large data set is a the more data available to test with the more accurate the results will be if you're looking for a way to manage your big data projects why not check out this infusion they did a platform Global license starts at $3,995 per year for unlimited use and can help you get going on your own machine learning projects we have none other than Chris gopala question the co-founder of emphasis on the founder of axle Adventures decoding the similarities and differences between artificial machine learning on the Internet of Things computer make human being they show human-like capabilities that called artificial intelligence but if they can recognize spoken spoken word that fall apart if she Linda Linda recognize object that's a form of artificial intelligence machine learning is one of the ways in which David the monster this capabilities or me enable the computer to the man turn this capability speech recognition learning means let me give sample speeches and tell the computer what's indeed mean so that to learning the computer becomes capable of doing this task intelligence of computing in everything that we see the things that we see so for example there could be in telegence built into a thermometer with controls the room temperature or there could be children in the car with directed to go to a particular location GPS in your car right when you embed Computing in sing and allow this to be interconnected allowed this to give you data information maybe even advice that's what testing you can also follow up on Twitter at eating a little before programming hit the Subscribe button on YouTube channels by logging on to YouTube. user / eating out dream of computer science division give computers the capabilities to see here learn analyze respond in ways that are more more intelligent machine learning is four aspects of artificial intelligence research focus and taking large amounts of data and building predictive models or classifiers that can interpret buy the world the way a smart person might be able to interpret the world even better sometimes when people interact with others we know they're smart they learn past interactions as machines are becoming a little smarter we using machine learning to help them improve interaction with humans right now we're observing that more and more data becomes available online and one great challenge is how can we prosess these play some data and so we're looking at what we called the scalability problem how can we make use of all this very valuable data in order to create experiences for the user that they useful for them and being him we have taken for the Vantage of so many years of Greeley research I'm a mess are and we can really Leverage The Power of machine learning to figure out at a personal level what's the user is really looking for and the what sensory South can we actually provide to the user want to create flexible adapter software that can help people in the variety of situations we invest in this area because it is challenging it is a great unknown it also has the opportunity of the results of these Explorations translate into much better experiences for our customers I think I'm learning is becoming so latest and the so importance and that I really feel like in a way I just said it's very beginning with swag with search in the water we can really do for the users biggest changes will see in the world will come from computer science over the next several decades to come from machine learning and intelligence in particular I believe always felt like we're betting that future at Microsoft research it's that simple birds that live in we're demonstrating our latest work and how machines can learn control policies by them sewing machines using our technology can learn how to perform complicated actions and acquire complex skills preferred Emirates focuses on deep learning for Internet of Things applications and we call this deep intelligence for networks so our technology can be applied to this will demonstrate in a moment as well as any kind of machine that needs to learn how to optimize its own behavior so a primary application that we see is in industrial robots industrial machines the need to learn how to work together to optimally and safely are technology uses reinforcement learning distributed learning and deep learning and the first demo shows race cars learning how to drive around a track they learn how to control themselves they learn how to avoid accidents and they do this without any human intervention so we didn't give race cars any specific rules or commands that they had to follow at the beginning of the learning process you can see that the cars have no skill they don't know anything about driving there just bumping into walls bumping into each other our technology gives them a reward when they drive successful and it gets them a penalty when they drive unsuccessfully and here is sort of the intermediate stage where the cars are able to drive some but still having a lot of accidents and this demonstrates the final stage after the learning has been completed and you can see that the cars are really prize their own behavior and their driving very fast without any accidents here were using the same technology to show how real robots learn how to control their behavior in a real situation put the robots of learned here is how to negotiate at an intersection without crashing into each other and you can see that the robots are actually learned very fine-grained behaviors even to the point where they can narrowly avoid collisions infants are born with the ability to imitate what people do a 10-minute old newborn sees another person stick their tongue out for the first time in response he sticks his own tongue out Nation allows humans to learn new behaviors rapidly we would like a robots to be able to in this way to train simulation the robot a new task by demonstrating how to assemble block towers in a particular way which in this case is a single stack of 6 virtualbox previously the robot at sea what are examples of manipulating blocks but not this particular one I Robot has now learned to perform the task even though its movements have to be different from the ones in the demonstration with single demonstration of the task we can replicate it in a number of different initial conditions teaching the robot how to build a different block Arrangement requires only a single additional demonstration here's our system works the robot perceive the environment with its manipulates two blocks with its armed report a demonstration the imitation Network figures out what action to take next are Vision network is a deep neural net that takes a camera image and determines the position of the blocks relative to the robot the Train the network for use only simulated data using Domaine randomization to learn robust fishing model regenerate thousands of different object low shins light settings and surface textures and show these examples to the network after training the network can find the blocks in the physical world even though it's never seen images from a real camera before it's known that is trained to predict what action the demonstrator would have taken in the same situation on its own it is learned to stand for the demonstration and pay attention to the road in frames tell it what to do next nothing in our technique is specific blocks SSM is an early prototype that will form the backbone of the general purpose robotics systems were developing here at open the eye South by Southwest 2017 standing here in the cookie booth in Austin Texas with and helmets who are responsible for this interesting demo behind this helmet can you tell us a little Bella what's going on behind us here what's a viral on social media recently as the Crickets are doing it and that's right if robot okay that is pretty cool with the robot there Charles can you tell us a little bit about how this came to be I mean we're trending I think I'll read it right now so what would you want to show off some of the capabilities it took a robotics a new audience the best robots are very strong and precise but often way in car factories in one season so I'm just way to expose it in a fun trying to weigh a to new audience play some comfy Minnesota challenge by all day I know that it's a really cool demo but there's some real technology be on there I guess could you tell me a little bit about why this is important for us as a software team here in Austin Lawrence kind of concept so it looks like just a fun day more but actually many problems that are kind of very hot Soldier robotics Apollo system out we are going will use it as a nice application where we can explore different type ratings in machine learning deep learning integrating Senza Centigrade conversion to make it even more fun if most attack by using this account Advanced Techniques at the same time learning about in a bottle I heard was a bit of a challenge maybe you could Charles you can tell us about what was the most challenging aspect to figure out how to do is for the robot the hardest part was just get into the repeatable making it so that the row every time that took some mostly just a lot of practice and help with the humans and that's exactly the process that often robotic Engineers go through it's kind of a difficult process to the hand tune the Motions are only needs to do and we're actually most in the lb new tools to help people do that without having maybe some painful right learning to learn to do this automatically so we can leave here overnight and throw the balls the stuff all night long connect in the morning it'll I really her lightly in a new environment new tables new bottles all that happen automatically that's really cool so sort of a Gen 2 of this might be one automatically teaches itself so any water bottle any combination any amount of water over night let's say while streaming maybe it won't be Jim Tooley moving around but will you see Mason as well which is a kind of dreaming about dreaming absolutely that's the vision okay so really fun bottle flipping robot here at the booth at South by Southwest 2017 what does you just learned from Charleston, here a lot more behind this than simply a fun demo so thanks I will see you later Intel medical research and Diagnostics customer data in retail hundreds of hours of video uploaded every minute billions of unstructured data points with valuable information hidden in them how to discover it with machine learning customers most important daytime SAP systems anyway what we offer or customers now is that we have time machine running through making all the applications intended combining massive

automatable work and is the first step towards bringing comprehensive automation touché service organizations everywhere we are entering the age of intelligent Enterprise powered by machine o'charles hi Michael how are you doing I'm doing okay good you know exciting to beginning to talk about reinforcement learning good morning it's my favorite type of learning it is true machine learning all the kinds of machine learning what what let's have a about giving the opportunity for the students in the class to learn about reinforcement learning by having us tell them about it let's do that we're going to build on this stuff hold us about last time well defined and will formalize stuff that we talked about last time and I'm going to talk about what it means to learn in that context excellent I find it useful to start off by thinking about a reinforcement learning API like application programmer interface so what you talked about is is this box here the idea of being to take a model of an MVP which consists of a transition function tee never Ward function are and it goes through some code and do you know comes out in the policy comes out right in the policy is is like pie Maps states to directions and that whole activity what would you call that would you call the the the problem of or the approach of taking models and turn them into policies set call them planning how to behave to maximize reward but a learner is going to do something different instead of taking a model as input it's going to take transition just going to take samples of being in some state taking some action observing a reward and observing the state that is at the other end of that transition all right and will and I put a little star on that to say what we're going to see a bunch of these transitions and using that information we're going to instead of computing a policy were going to learn a policy so we call that learning how do I what makes it reinforcement question but it's a question stop there was a bad question it says I don't have a pretty good answer for it so maybe we did another slide to discuss that okay I logged in a what makes this really unique is applying machine learning cutting-edge technology to Wards a industry that hasn't been touched before log did I ask you sorry by accident rebuilt an internal to ourselves to diagnose oral problems and we were in the incubator call y-combinator we decide to put it we realize what we built internally was more powerful than the original I do we had as a star but we first started at lunch we are interesting very few customers but now ingesting billions of events per day in terabytes of data and as your helped us to skill and work on some of those challenges so logged in looks at all your server logs so much you like analyzing your own DNA to determine is there any production issues in your technology and can weed proactively help you open or help you react faster to fixing the problems before Azure we were using AWS and we switched as you're mainly because of the parts and service we've been receiving from Microsoft in a lot of writers they all just use different terminology to describe some more things and the hardest part was not really the tick the hardest part is just figuring out when I watch pieces translate from one provider to another and then Microsoft team was tremendous and helping us help with that translation and what's migrate over today we have over 2,000 customers save us as a true partner from Business Development to getting to the marketplace we love working with Asher cuz they have the technical capabilities to help us grow for the future
