in this work we describe how to build Mirai displays using truffées only Holograms are approaches to build a holographic projector based on the spell stuff for nail holography we build our Holograms fighting a series of sub Holograms Each of which can focus light at the different types of a scene we use a variant double face technique to control amplitude using a phase only spatial light modulator hear one example face hologram using a smooth face profile we can buy are graphic projector with fairy side pieces to build virtual reality displays are creation of high-quality full color Holograms with high resolution and image quality can we show a photograph of an image taken on a prototype display this hologram was calculated at a color-field rate of 260 hurts the field of view is 70 degrees horizontal we compute Holograms in the GPU is the post processing step after the standard rendering pipeline we're able to render Holograms in real time from standard polygonal mod here we show video of our prototype with real time rendering and holographic computation calculated at a rate of over 150 hurts we can also display models with purpose Focus control enabling true 3D Holograms with depth of field in this video we focus through the very steps of hologram on a prototype display by changing only Locus ring of the camera to speed of computation we can also set the focus based on the track ID position this scene is computed in real time with a focus that to the depth of the cursor after moving the cursor we can adjust the camera Focus to match the track. The focus are displays also capable of crafting Saxon the user's Vision here we placed an additional lens in front of the camera to introduce astigmatic Vision here we show a photograph of our display with normal vision what is tekmatic Vision stigmatic Vision in the Hologram producing an image that looks virtually the same as the image taken with normal vision constructed holographic displays for see-through augmented reality applications will use a thin flat holographic Optical element as an optical combiner here we show Naga minutes chain on a prototype augmented reality device we also created a much smaller augmented reality prototype consisting of a minute rice holographic projector watch to an eyeglass like frame holographic Optical element cut in the shape of an eyeglass lens serves as the optical combiner the field of view of the devices 80° whores however the compact Optical design causes severe aberrations that result in an unrecognizable image however we can correct the operations inside the holographic projector resulting in high resolution over the entire field of view that's are holographic approach allows us to achieve fields of you inform factors inaccessible through conventional Optics we can also accelerate computation by correcting operations only near the track by position here are the operations are corrected around the position of the cursor are we sure that after correction we are able to resolve text that is only one pixel wide note that there is only a one pixel space between the. Of the letter i are compact Whitefield of you displays may be used for a variety of augmented reality applications when you think of Microsoft you're probably not thinking wearables and yet Microsoft has gone ahead and made yet another Act tracking wristband simply called the Microsoft Band This is actually a follow-up to last year's Microsoft band which was a pretty capable Fitness tracker but it was a little bit more expensive than other trackers and it definitely was not going to win any Design Awards so what's new with the new $249 Microsoft fans and will I win people over considering something like the Fitbit or even the Apple watch Microsoft says it's making a fitness fan because it cares about your health that's a nice yarn to spin but for a lot of these companies activity tracking devices are an easy way to get better understanding of consumers habits interests and Lifestyles but there's no doubt that the Microsoft band is very fitness-focused does new van has a slightly curved design which is a welcome change from the angularity of last year's band it also has a new OLED display coded and Corning Gorilla Glass it certainly looks a lot nicer than last year but it's still not the most comfortable band to wear especially to sleep there are two physical buttons in the band one that triggers the display backlight and another one action button that stops and starts your activities otherwise it's all touch screen all the time that's how you see your activity check the time and mainly interact with the band like shows Microsoft and this one has Optical heart-rate sensors to get your heart rate readings from the wrist although the placement of these has changed and like last year's band it has built-in GPS turn the Apple watch most definitely does not have if you're comparing that is a fitness device the new van now includes a barometer for measuring your elevation and like last year's band it works with court Microsoft virtual personal assistant that you access through voice control so what can you actually do with the band well it's rex runs bike rides and golf swings stairs Merrick exercise tile for when you're doing something else like lifting weights or practicing yoga and there's a tile for adding preset Orkut demise workouts you can for exam go go into the Microsoft health app and download a workout from Gold's Gym or Shape magazine or even make your own work out you will retrievers you even measures your VO2 max something serious athletes like to take note of it's not meant to track swimming go so serious overachievers like triathletes need not apply and battery life isn't great my van lasted just under okay especially if I track workouts for two days in a row also thinking the band's data to the Microsoft health app on iOS is painfully slow something that Microsoft how old is the problem some days it just didn't work it's like if it doesn't track it did it even happen on the upside Microsoft band works with Windows phone Android that's making it one of the few totally platform-agnostic activity trackers out there and you can see a lot of data in the app how many steps you take in for the day what percentage of Y articles you've reached your most recent workouts or sleep data assuming of course that you've sucked it up anymore in the thing to bed and that your data sings to the app Microsoft health gets even more singular when you log into the website another good thing about this band that shares information freely with other popular health and fitness apps so if you're into Strava or RunKeeper or my Chris Powell or lose it for data will show up there in a lot of ways than Microsoft band is a very capable tracker the inclusion of GPS is great and I like the automatic sharing of data to craps but I just can't get passed away it looks and feels on my wrist even with the improved design and 2 day battery life that's getting into Smartwatch territory where is if you're looking at more fitness-focused devices of Garmin or a Fitbit surge will get you doubled or what so even with the improvements made to the band paper sucks and is still a bit of an identity what's on your wrist when did I can't say is my number one pick really excited to hear a new CD today or we have 800 young girls participating in a girls in ICT day we're hoping to get them inspired sizes of careers in the future in the tech industry I would definitely encourage girls to pursue careers in technology and two the same subject and I can tell them there was a space for everyone in the an engineering and Technology field with worked with mellow and sons who 6th generation beavers and done Eagle true creating surface decoration that we do that truth in design for CAD double use the surface technology to create music can I use music production software would you like me to Roy's produce record and then also play live so that software I can use it to run different controllers when I play just brings the whole thing together and brings it to life for me I would give the girls here today the advice that technology degrees can be fabulous they should think about pursuing a degree in stem because it will open up many many doors for them and their careers ahead creamsicle Shake I lost my sight when I was seven and shortly after that I went to a school for the blind and that's where it was interesting talking to Peters and that radio up and up a whole new world of opportunities I join Microsoft 10 years ago case of rain today I love making things which improve people's lives and one of the things of glowing strepto of since I was at University was this idea something that could tell you if anybody went what's going on around you I think it's a trick on a skateboard tight end up with like-minded Engineers to make an app which lets you know who and what is Randy it's based on top of the soft intelligence API which makes it so much easier to make this kind of thing the app runs on smartphones but also on the pivothead smart glasses when you talking to a bigger group talking to can there's no response and you think is everyone listening really well or are they have asleep he never died I see two faces 40 year old man with a beard looking surprised 20 year old woman looking happy if you can describe the general age and gender of the people around me and what their emotions are which is incredible what are things that's most go back the app is the ability to read our texts picture of the menu and it's going to guide me on how to take that correct photo from the document read me the heavens I see appetizers salads paninis pizzas pastas never thought it would be something that you could actually do but artificial intelligence is improving at another faster rate that I'm really excited to see where we can take this listen today's will weigh standing on the shoulders of giants building on top of what went before I'm in this case we've taken years of research on Microsoft research to pull this off make it to young girl throwing an orange frisbee in the park for me and building it one step at a time I think this is just

staircase and then start to measure every step hololens guy you through the process but that was just a very beginning you realize that's the hololens is not just another rheumatology actually performing Digital Data capturing so the clothes would be as a cloud we are actually able to transport all the data gathered by The Orleans to Outkast database and all accounting systems in real-time and forwarded to the manufacturing site way stop production that is a completely new use delivering and product with hololens we could triple X pasta we can show the animation like hey this is your

connectivity that's plenty of potential and resist partnership with Microsoft isn't rope will transform poles to make life better that is a game changer when I sought the surface to do for the first time with the drops a little bit surface Style with the studio that takes place it's definitely redefining the concept of dust cop what was principally design for pen and touch input the surface Studio fits it to a tee with the surface Studio price all immediately was the size of the screen for you're doing if you're trying to be productive real estate matters the really special thing about the surface dial is when we can change the color while you're painting without even picking up the tip that's not just as good as real life it's better at bluebeam software we make solutions for the architecture engineering and Construction Industries with the surface Studio you really have a new collaborative way of interacting with documents it is essentially the angle is the drafting table you're more immersed in the technology that once you're down in studio mode with the dial and it was an off screen and on-screen presence until I can work however make to me that's okay I'm drawing with 3D capabilities you could draw on a yes but then you can also project your Strokes into space with surface Studio at you just get this fluid experience of creation that's just not possible anywhere else so far as in seamless and is going to the way that people do work at their desk once you start to use it and you don't feel like you are working with a computer anymore you feel like the computer serving y rather than the other way around this is Jeanette and hear the stories that matter right now at an event in New York focused on education Microsoft announced a new Surface laptop

to begin with would be great that would developer come and she'll switch possible with professional productivity and who know better about productivity then Microsoft yeah these guys no productivity so I am extremely please could you do corporate vice president from Microsoft Office Kurt koenig's Bower Kirk thank you Richard it's a thrill to be here today A Microsoft were focused on Reinventing productivity to help people do their best work anywhere they're working today more than ever we are supporting Microsoft Office on Apple platforms see a beautiful Microsoft Word document on the gorgeous new iPad Pro not with the iPad we want to make it easy for anyone to create Rich content and documents touch it's a watch a quick example here we can just with a few quick Taps take this table add Styles and turn it into a really really great document extend this richness with a new iPad Pro with ink so we can allow anyone to markup and annotate their documents and collaborate with others and so if you look underneath the rib and you'll see we have of Lady of New Penn tools there's different pens and pencils once a highlighter you see this fabulous new color wheel so you can pick just the color that you want and Anu thickness control so you can point that you need now watch as we can use the apple pencil and circle items in our document we can strike through we can add suggestions and we can write in the margins and Y say it's also great for multilingual usage to all of these changes are stored in the document itself and can be viewed on Microsoft Office application on any device so we'll take advantage of quick swipe we can have both Word and Excel on the screen at the same time now having these two applications side by side at allows us to do things like copy and paste this chart that you see and put it into Microsoft Word now let's finish up our PowerPoint presentation that goes a song with this document that were working on and once again will use iOS 9 multitasking capabilities both apps up on the screen at the same time and we can copy this chart also into our PowerPoint presentation shut up just like we're just like Excel PowerPoint has great support for the apple pencil and for ink and so watch as we can go ahead and draw some shapes here are on our slide in there converted automatically to graphic object let's take this let's take this to the next level will go to this light see it has just a simple list we want to turn this into a high-impact diagram that we can use the apple pencil or just touch here we'll just use touch and watch as we draw three circles let's draw three circles and you will see the PowerPoint converts them automatically into shapes that will support shape recognition lower 20 different object type so you can take your hand drawn art and annotations and convert them into professional-looking content so this is the new Microsoft Office on the new iPad add add Microsoft we really believe that bringing together the iPad Pro with Microsoft Office the ink the multitasking capabilities will really transform the way people work Wisconsin devices thank you very much I'm really passionate climate change I'm worried that there will be enough fresh water for everybody I want to make sure that we're able to have us self-sustaining environment but interest is to find a cure for cancer because my mom had it the cracks are lower the water is being sick like this I think I want to help do that that makes no sense to me like why why would that be there's always going to be someone that said like no you can't do it where is amazing isn't it like we can do as much stuff as they can I want my name to be there to be like Marley just want to help stop this climate change issue I will discover a cure for breast cancer we need all hands on deck right now wishing the impacting workers had an offworld what if T is going to Chi viven more to truly do work we need people that have experiences and

how to work with people from different cultures in Generations could come together in a more purposeful way so ideas for freely and involve organically just imagine what we could achieve introduced in Microsoft teams in Office 365 Mark softer I'm excited about the ability for people to be engaged in multiple teams in making it very easy for them to not have to go to 15 different places Microsoft Splat space that gives people one place to connect and create in and heading to human waste all right there in a single interface is nearly 400,000 people across 120 countries to be able to engage in fiber 8 this way it's a big game changer for us the way to build trust and help straighten natural Rhythm so ideas for freely and involve organic name there's a lot of communication there's a lot of data sharing we're all sort of working towards the same Google knots to build a car that goes out on the racetrack to went in a very frictionless way that's the way people expect to work these days that's part of The Office 365 set of collaboration tools to part of what we already do if it's the central Hub or the conversations happen it opens possibilities for connection and collaboration never thought was possible before then it's about empowering them and taking somebody's good idea and making it a awesome idea he made us more efficient this is exactly what we've been waiting for this is
