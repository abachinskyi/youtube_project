yesterday what city is on the deed, just needs to watch this video Billy's Donuts locations iPhone users Rejoice at least if you hate Siri because it's just refer Gaara what's going on everybody and Google assistant is now on iOS not given apples propensity light on it so as it comes as no surprise that the system is not quite as easy to launch as Siri after always super you can use the hot word he Siri and you'll be able to get straight into its function say and do a lot of different things however when it comes to Google Assistant you have to say Okay Google only after opening up the app so once you're all set up with the Google assistant how does it compare to raped while in a lot of ways assistant actually proves to be a bit better than Siri however third-party limitations kind of put them on even footing you might be wondering if you can make a call or text using assistant you're definitely can't fix variances about the same one saying something like call Joshua Vergara assistant brings up the number and places to call with the option to cancel the call and then when text Joshua Vergara assistant asked you for the message then asked you to confirm before booting over two messages were then you have to press send Siri is able to finish these stabs what you having to do extra input but Google also natively does this on Android we loaded up music and Siri opens up Apple music by default and plays music automatically while assistant requires you to choose between something like YouTube and playing via Apple music searching for specific songs will make you choose between the two and then it will default to that for future ones unless you specify exactly which application you want to use this is really an example of how these two different ecosystems IOS and Android are really trying to coexist here but they're always go will be a few pitfalls in the translation from one to the other which is not really surprising to us but if you use Google's own apps instead of apples then you'll probably love assistant the way that many Droid fans do to send an email you tell assistant who to send it to and it will go straight into Gmail other wise you can also do navigation and it will use Google Maps instead of Apple Maps which is a good thing if you I'm salt assistant also now has the updated explore page that some Android users have been enjoying already in which you can find useful suggestions as well as a separate tab called your stuff where I can show everything that you have done via the assistant application so overall iOS does limit Google Assistant just a little bit but that is the disconnect between you what ecosystems as we mentioned earlier there are some features that Google Assistant doesn't Android that aren't available on iOS but we're sure that that can come in different updates later on whether it's on the apps or even on the iOS side and that kind of development is something that we're looking forward to after all this
