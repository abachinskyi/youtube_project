Augusta ssssss this is Troy's Apple self-driving car has been spotted driving down the road here's a on YouTube number this is for Mac rumors Apple got the permit to test their autonomous vehicles last month and that there are I think about 5 or 6 Lexus look oh look there it is some is driving around it looks like yes and Lexus did you do with all lighter on the roof doesn't say apple anywhere it's the right color same platform that a lot of companies have been buying as a test platforms for stuff so it's for their probably mostly checking while Bobby State have to be checking their software anything else your vision screw up like if they're doing machine learning like they most of their spending an unknown amount of time teaching this car deal with people in cell phones getting too close cuz they want to get pictures of the self-driving car still isn't it for like Hollywood celebrities are going to be stalked by Paparazzi this break is going to the target market fast release Flac nonopro school is like for the holidays roosters near me cause no matter how far away you when is Christmas who is DJ from Full House hey guys is good to see you again I'm back today with a fun and simple little experiment that you can try at home the only materials are going to need for this product or an apple and knife as Ziploc bag and some paper towel never this product today I thought it'd be fun to see if we could actually sprout an apple seed now when you were a kid there's a good chance your parents told you not to eat apple seeds or swallow watermelon seeds because it would sprout a your stomach but that's not necessarily true because there's quite a process to getting a seed to sprout and that is the purpose of this experiment today not to get started we need to extract the seeds from a wrap so you could just eat it and pull the seeds out as you do where he could grab a knife and cut very carefully at a 45 degree angle to the center okay so once you got your seeds separated from the apples go ahead and one sheet of paper towel and something like this little water mr. are going to do is take her paper towel we're going to fold it in half lengthwise and set it down on the counter there going to use her a little mystery to get at 5 6 raised on one side then flip it over and give it five to six shots on the other side the goal is we want to get this thing damp but we don't want it to be wet alright with her paper towel moisten we can go ahead and take mule are apple seeds and place them down into a line somewhere in the top half area the only thing left to do after that is to fold the paper towel and half over top of the seeds place it into a ziplock bag and seal it tight so we have the guys just like that we now have five are apple seeds tucked away inside the moist paper towel and locked in a ziplock bag by the way it's not a bad idea to Mark the date under the bag do you know when the three weeks is up north into the back of her fridge and completely forget about it for the next 3 weeks now it's magic of editing we fast forward into the future tell me extempo clap of our hands room here we are three weeks later let's go check our results I'm actually really curious to see what we got here his bag has done nothing but sit in that fridge for three weeks in the dark completely and neglected in the first thing I notice is the paper towel is actually still quite moist Oak Lake Dam which would make sense because it was in a sealed ziplock bag right let's peel back the top layer and Sue Scott oh my goodness look at that are seeds that actually sprouted some more than others these two over here seem to have taken off quite vigorously and viciously miss you over here you can see little sprouts and this one's got a little bud coming out there as well all five are seeds to sprout it which I think is pretty cool and if we want to we can move your things to a seeds without them establishing roots and begin biting into a tree and if we wanted to we could actually grow them into apple trees which is kind of mind-blowing but I have to crush your expectations even if you put prison years of effort into growing your own apple tree the chances of your apples tasting like the one you grew this from are very very slim the reason is because in our industry today most of the apples are what's it on to existing roof structures so even though you use the seeds from an Apple you like the apples you grow from it will taste completely different so they had a guy's now you know how to take the seeds right out of the Apple anything stick them in the fridge for a few weeks and grow an apple tree right in your own backyard thanks for join me for this experiment I'll be looking for your next one talk to you then bye
