that's a perfect City for electric vehicles sense of movement that sense of dynamism Hong Kong people want to go everywhere fast lessons on the street of seeing I just have double triple now mean to see easily doesn't Tesla's all the roads every single day when I test drove it I just couldn't stop thinking about the car afterwards it's the combination of the practicality of add the performance all the cutting action Knology inside the vehicle calls on the road today if the safest was very good sports car I drive a Tesla superchargers all the most convenient locations of people can charge while they're out shopping will you have face no Tesla only song you don't have to worry about running out of battery Station 21 to reduce the carbon footprint specially here in Hong Kong we need to preserve their quality that right side pollution driving a Tesla it's entirely quiet and there are just no emissions so smooth and so quiet you're almost in this your own little bubble and when you're inside the amidst all this noise around you hey guys today I want to give you guys a quick overview of how home charging works for a Tesla that's a huge question that I had when I was first purchasing my car is I scoured the web trying to find out what exactly does this look like in a typical garage so I want to show you guys escalation that I got in my garage and as you can see here we've got the Nema 1450 Outlet here that's connected to my breaker box out there and what are you guys too what that looks like in a second but Nema 1450 the 50 stands for the amount of amperage just this thing is pulling from my box but typically the Maxima this plug will uses 40 amps but this mobile connector comes with the Tesla and we've got this accessory from Tesla believe it cost about $25 basically a cable organizer and this thing is not magnetic but it kind of clips into this so every day when I come in here basically take this out press the I'm in charge my vehicle but this is exactly what the setup looks like so now let's go around back I'll show you guys how this Nema 1450 Outlet is one from outside the house and into the garage because I'll follow behind me I'll show you guys so this is basically my circuit breaker number 3 can hear is 13 but here is where they install the Tesla outlet and a basically this wire I hear from the the line is what runs underneath my house over here and a basically runs underneath here all the way until you said over here the basically they did a tee into the inside of inside the house and that's where the outlet comes out on other side so charging a Tesla just like charging a mobile phone basically every day when I come in I plugged the car in and like I was explaining earlier you take this out press on this button Dillon Gage where you charge the vehicle and you plug it in and you'll see here in a little bit when the light starts oscillating green is when the charging commences charging you can see at the very top it'll tell you that the car is charging it has about an hour and 15 minutes first time the car right now is that 200 for my typically one if I charge to 90% I get about 225 miles range and you can see the amperage instead of 40 amps is charging it 30 amps just as a safety precaution it doesn't need to charge all the way of and if you're at home in the car is done charging the app will give you a notification to let you know that the your car is done charging and you're right go sign the morning whenever you're leaving one of the first things to keep in mind and this is a mistake that I can't make it in the beginning is when the car is locked when the handlebars are can you try to pull this thing out the car will not let you take the plug out so that you know people can't really steal your car when it's charging so you have to make sure that the car is on typical of I'm walking up to the car the car will automatically unlock but when it unlocks whenever you press this button basically what happens is the light instead of turning Greenville from Blue to a white color to white man's is ready to be pulled out and once you do that the plug will you put this thing back in and the plug a lot sparkly clothes and you're ready to go Tesla Model X mulching Australia before the end of this year we thought we'd come down to Tesla and have a look at the first example in the country with a starting price of a little over an $11,000 before on-road cost you can say the model X has a very similar front end to the updated model list putting a different set of headlights with plays Kool LED light on running lot and I told slice it to me the fastest SUV in Australia when it does arrive but it does have a few tricks up its like one of them is the signature falcon wings all which you can either activite by pressing that pennellville using the key and just double tapping hit from the door pops open uses all its senses to make sure it's not going to hit anything Ellen reveals this interior which is really cool what are the biggest troll cards of the model Lakes is of course the fact that you can option 7 seats so in addition to his sick and Route having sight adjustment actually has a really clever mechanism for climbing into that third row even for toilet paper so I with one push of the button it brings the second row forward and it will move the best right forward as well if there's not enough room and then once it's ready to go all you do is climbing and sit down I guess advantages of having seats in the second row that sit on a single pole is it you have plenty of leg and tyrants and you'll Sipes of Hitler in here as well but the question is with a lot of seven sages is they actually any good room when she's got this third row up well the answer is yes that's because you have plenty of storage room behind the Third Road please Sonny's Handy Storage cavity beneath the floor when you pull it back it reveals a massive hole with a fuel tank with live in a normal cop so in addition to that as well you'll say have the front what you think enough for to prance or even a golf bag had the biggest Advantage here is that but pressing that hidden button broke down you can actually lower both sides to revealed even more room the biggest change is actually these were if he which extends all the way from heat down to the front of the cop mini needed a panoramic view of what's outside with deliveries to start at the end of the year cake and card boss.com for the lightest Tesla news and reviews what security of the Internet connect to devices that we use in our daily lives heavily depends on the apps use to access monitor can control the devices I was showing easy way how would you can obtain the username and password to log into the app and you stopped control is the method to use for this really simple and they have been known for years and have been also used by cybercriminals for a long time one of the plus I've prayed to the free Wi-Fi hotspot that describes an advertisement of Target to watch Tesla owners that says that if you install this free app you can free burger at the restaurant close by so I can see now here lashes looked into my Wi-Fi hotspot what type of now is that what's the trick to install an app on this phone that bends over on his phone and the power is manipulating the Tesla phones device books in to see one password to me so now I can see you what is talking if I was really a criminal I would have done the snow during the day working on the big laptop but they would probably use more phone or something but this is just castration would be over there can old last thing I threw up to be able to car with old having the key that's all supposed to mow the keenest driving so Naval which means you can just drive over the car call Toys R Us kool people think of factories too much like it's some sort of photocopy machine I just it's just some boring thing that makes copies but actually it's fashionable complicated Sonic that makes many of our customers particularly those in dense urban areas understand the difficulty in finding a legal parking spot and over-the-air software update will be going out vehicles that allow Model S to automatically detect the presence of a meter maid or law enforcement officer if Model S detect an imminent ticket it will deploy countermeasures which are the ticket writer from issuing the ticket the windshield wipers and washers will be activated to turning the ticket writer in the event that the ticket issue model last will enter ticket avoidance mode and ticket avoidance mode the vehicle will autonomously drive in circles around the block until the ticket issue Brett is no longer detected if the threat of a ticket has passed the vehicle will park and its original parking spot otherwise it will continue to drive block the message will be pushed via the mobile app alerting the user that ticket avoidance mode has been activated and Model S is on the move the autonomous driving 7 feature will automatically be activated in ticket avoidance mode and Model S will pick you up with parking ticket to turns and ticket avoidance mode Model S has you covered long-forgotten will be the days of parking ticket where's we like to call them receipts for premium parking I drove the electric 2016 Tesla MDD all over New York and it was faster more comfortable and more practical than I hoped so here are a couple things that you should know about the Tesla p90d this new version of the model S looks like the past versions it has a suite 21 inch wheels the panoramic glass sunroof the swoop sides the sick LED daytime running lights and the rear play that they do and like other models it gets the equivalent of a whopping 89 miles per gallon in the city and 98 miles per gallon on the highway put it in ludicrous mode and you'll feel a major change it is winding Leaf act when everybody says the little Chris mode is faster any other sedan you can go ahead and believe them because this thing will blow your mind when you get in he really push it down the car will hit 60 miles lower in 2.8 seconds end of acceleration there's no pause for Gears to shift that's one of the benefits of it being electric and the company claims that the car hits 1.1 Gees so it feels unlike any other car today Tesla has continue to refine and improve the interior technology the 17-inch touchscreen console work seamlessly to control music navigation climate and battery usage the range is roughly 300 miles the seats provide ample supported room for long backs long legs and Tall heads the rear has that famous extra two seat off but I like the enormous trunk you get when you stick with the standard 5 seat configuration so out of all the amazing features and cool technology and software in this car are there one thing that stood out to me as something that's a little off and it's a fact that to shift you shift on the steering column like the old cars from the 50s and 60s like you literally will it down to go into drive and push it up to go into reverse which is kind of nuts because everything else in the car is a touch screen or a button Tesla has done a great job of making sure we get a lot for our money hear everything from the forward and rear cameras Wi-Fi and navigation are included in the $8,000 base price things like the carbon fiber spoiler upgrade and High Fidelity sound package not to mention $10,000 ludicrous mode and the numbers quickly add up the price tag of the car I drove was almost $140,000 it's not cheap but believe me you'll get your money's worth and then some Tesla Model S features got a major update giving the car is powerful self-driving features however the company made it expressly clear those fie are still in beta and Driver should still keep their hands on the wheel naturally some drivers are ignoring that advice so the featuring question is out is there an which is pretty self-explanatory it allows the model less than siret self at highway speeds modern the traffic ahead and keep me in the single-lane this is without question really cool but this is a big but this technology is really young and should never ever be taken for granted but yeah people are totally taking it for granted I got it this is exciting stuff and thankfully no one's gotten hurt but taking her hands off the wheel and letting the car do whatever it wants using beta software is probably a bad idea not right there go now is it worth questioning why Tesla Louise unfinished software to its customers who are driving real cars in the real world of course that shouldn't be downplayed parental self-driving cars are perfected and that's clearly a long way off it still fully on people to drive safely an earlier Tesla received a very rough ride from the BBC's Top Gear program next up all the PVC with pumpkins brush Kentucky was even on the BBC so what do you think of Jeremy Clarkson Clarkson Clarkson show is much more about entertainment than is about truth and I think most people realize that but not everyone and a lot of his shows so it's not as though I just hate Top Gear or anything he can be very funny when an irreverent but he does have a strong bias against electric cars any particular seems hate American like his two pet peeves are Americans American cause electric cause an American electric car in the worst possible situation for someone like Clarkson sweetie this is a reactivity Eurovision trying to convert Jeremy Clarkson electoral so high I was touching my Tesla Tower you know the problem is play can't stand the thought that I didn't test it properly and the glow I got in the vacuum was not representative because I was wasting power so I'm going to cut the molten head off and try again if you reduce the inductance of the secondary which will affect the resonance frequency button for it can break it up with a mallet Joe Hart super almond age scraping the insulation off of the surface with a knife connect the top load toroid to one end now hot glue everything into before you can first use that Slayer Exciter circuit to measure the resonance frequency of your Tower or you can just simply try to adjust the freak shut the circuit sometimes you just want to test something quickly what it's never quick is it okay fix let's would you own it now color is vacuum service vacuum time everyone forgot about that one try again maybe not a complete vacuum can I found it again damn it trying to melt my tower again more and more bubble wrap Richard hopefully do it it won't our counselor is a better vacuum look at this now stomach it's running away from me look at this man the pressure of the glass splitted my cynic washer in half time not only that our was actually our King from Top here to bottom dear I think is projekt cursed I probably won't get anything candles glow balls anyway so screw it at least I have my timer back in operation you know Angels growing electrical balls they sell out there they don't create a vacuum what will the gases like neon those gases have the same effect as vacuum because they're holding their electrons very strongly so they can't create plasma that easily and so the voltage Rises and can further and another benefit of those gases is that you don't have to create a vacuum it's the same pressure inside and out so it's much safer to use these projects like beating a dead lizard it's not it's much easier if I could fill the glass with noble gases what you already know the outcome of that one so forget about it you ready for this in the backseat first impression behind the wheel of the car is that it looks and feels a lot like a model S but your perspective is hiring but a better visibility especially thanks to panoramic windscreen which goes all the way up over your head and then some performance of the car feels very good ludicrous mode it was very good indeed zero to 60 and 3.2 seconds that's just chance of a second slower than the last and very quick for a car this size even the slower cars will do 0 to 60 in under 4 seconds which is absolutely unheard of in this kind of grief handles very well as well not quite as well as the model S but again compared to other SUVs it feels really great on the road especially going through the Twisted b**** is a doors open really wide and high so if you need to put someone in a child seat for example you can reach in here really easily without having to duck down or tucked behind seat specially nice and easy to do play back here on Switched up kind of far but I can move it back if seats are mounted on Central pillars which makes them easier to get in and out is also room underneath this you can run some packages behind ready to go just push this button and after the beep door start to come down just said easily now in case you're worried about these doors hitting the roof parking garage door that kind of thing their ultrasonic sensors of their much like a parking sensor will detect if there's anything above it will keep the door from opening the doors will always open to some degree cigars can make out at least not run in your ceiling selling a signature edition starting at a whopping $132,000 the lower-cost model going to have to wait for that organ have to be waiting a long time before you and I can buy one too I got some 30,000 free oras to get through before anybody will be able to go into the store and buy one but right now it's a great start the car drives great it feels great it's really high and it's a stem forward I'm looking forward to seeing more of these on the road how cosy back here certainly better than the station wagon my parents had when I was a kid will Tesla Model S p90d is nothing short of an automotive Revolution a fully electric 762 horsepower $100,000 Smallville with an autopilot feature that empowers the truly lazy drivers to revolutionize that commute and all friends at slow news day got their hands on one good morning sunshine hey we're still haven't crashed so Highway 65 in rush hour traffic on a Friday and we're going to test this out a pilot out on what would be a normal commute in the city it's not a self-driving car but it will autopilot your one year staying on the same road about to engage cans are office and we're right now off the pedal right now I'm not doing anything to Tarzan actually driving itself as we speak Navigator the straight away problem so it was time to give it a real test this is this is pretty big that's not your normal my hands are office and will add to make sure your hands are off is doing it it is it's doing it doing it really well to look at this view while driving one lane I wanted to find out if it can change lanes automatically to I'm going to use my blinker to get over it'll be aware of that yes and it did it and it's aware of the car in front of us and it slowed down and that was that was insane I was close that was that was a close I was that was awesome became clear that we were in good hands with the p90d but with all the new free time the autopilot afforded us or we going to do with it right and I'm going to don't try this at home so we're still in the autopilot haven't had to touch it if the car has taken care of would play Django who play checkers the car is taken care of the fact that we are still safely and we're completely negligent about driving safely now that we've had our fun it was time to return the Tesla to its owner trying out the Insane Mode acceleration before giving it back today I'm Adam we will see you next time then gauge so they call it in safe mode looking for me already grabbed Tudy's Taqueria Corona cigarette people pooping in the pool Google Voice London the van I do not know Jordan River this is our Tesla Model S p85d then you may have seen other videos and test online but this is not a borrowed car from Tesla what is fully electric car for $128,000 and put it to her own rigorous test here in some reports all sorts of tests today we are highlighting three tests avoidance maneuver breaking and acceleration the boys Gruber simulate swerving out of your lane to avoid hitting an obstacle in the road and then swarming back of your lane to avoid oncoming traffic we use to drive an average of the fastest time through the course without hitting a cone we're not relying on spedometer or stopwatch we use a laser to measure the car's precise speed adjudge watches the test make sure the cones escape on touched so how did it do a quick with the optional 21-inch wheel package are car made it through 55.5 miles per hour that's really good performance car numbers for a big luxury car like this the avoidance maneuver course is part of our 300 47 acre test facility we monitor the surface friction of more than three miles of roads to make sure all cars have an equal playing field get reliable break numbers the car has to be fully broken in before this or any other track test we drive the car at least 2000 miles the day be where we do brake testing we do 10 half G stops to make sure the brakes are seated in just right we start the test when the driver hits the pedal not when the car begins to slow that's the only way to measure the permits of the whole system after multiple stops and special sections are track and adjusting for the track temperature found it take just a hundred eighteen ft to stop on dry pavement from 60 miles per hour and 129 ft in a wet that's sports car territory never ever once in videos about how fast the p85d has 4 when it says insane mode in really music are GPS based vbox measurement equipment is accurate down to 2 cm will do 4 different run to each way to concert in E Minor singer track slope differences and here's the final result the p85d Rockets from zero to 60 in 3.5 seconds that's the quickest car we've ever tested but it doesn't quite match the 3.1 seconds claimed by Tesla that's why we do all of this let's sum up 55 and a half forever through the boys mover only 118 feet to stop on dry pavement and just three and a half seconds to 60 miles per hour those are world-class numbers an all out of an electric car that gets the equivalent of 87 miles per gallon yes we tested that to this proves that you could support higher fuel economy standard without sacrificing performance and a consumer reports We Believe than improving fuel efficiency is a vital Initiative for more on the Tesla Model S check out Consumer Report cyborg towns going to pronounce so I put it in sport insane mode I mean just perfect loadrite make sense so you just come to a complete stop 70 miles an hour krooks Brooks what she did in your sleep okay that's enough okay I got it holy s*** stop funny you okay to feel like a rollercoaster where did the snow buildup it just when do you do that like that complete stop so totally quiet that's the insane button right there and then crazy and insane mode Insane Mode on the car so basically I'm going to press that bustle 65 miles an hour I mean takes you by surprise right another 65 miles everyday Tesla Model S has been updated for the 2017 model year changes to the front the interior and also the reed diffuser Wakely with the first conduit in the we'll talk about this in a bit more detail so you can say some changes he to the front end which of improved error play next track your play the most impressive changes he in the headlights they had lots of change from Verizon to full La Dee and the reductive as well which means he'll turn with bearing Wilson artists of the LED pain is now one single line as opposed to individual Atlantis to the side skirt switching now body color supposed to just plain black revision to the reed diffuser and a reed diffuser is now black as opposed to having the crunch trip like a div on the previous car this one hasn't really broken with the formula KI which is a good thing for one of the main parts that did change was this Santa which was always a problem in the old card is here which means you can put things in without them sliding around which was was a problem when you had ludicrous mode on Toyota quite features is a filtration system from the model X the air filtration system can block up to 99.97% of polar sound of bad things from other vehicles and of course it comes with a very cool 9 a bioweapon defense mode which is activated by pressing this button Rocky what's the 27 X Tesla Model S keep your eye on powdered ross.com for when we get behind the wheel and take it for a test drive send text.
